CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
  HOW MESSIRE GILLES DE CROHIN WENT FOR AN<br />
  EXCURSION INTO THE LAND OF DREAMS<br />
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
When Gilles de Crohin, Sire de Froidmont, received
that sabre-cut upon his wrist&mdash;a cut, by the way,
which had been dealt with such efficacy that it very nearly
severed his left hand from his arm&mdash;he swore, so I
understand, both lustily and comprehensively.  I have not a
faithful record of what he did say, but from what I know
of Messire, I can indeed affirm that his language on the
occasion was as potent as it was direct and to the point.
</p>

<p>
As for the weapon which had dealt that same forceful
stroke, its triumph was short-lived.  Within the next few
seconds its unconscious career upon this earth was brought
to a sudden and ignominious close: it was broken into
three separate pieces by a blow more vigorous than even
Messire Gilles himself had ever been known to deal.  The
hilt went flying sky-high above the heads of the nearest
combatants; part of the blade was ground into the mud
under the heel of Messire's stout leather boot, whilst the
point itself&mdash;together with a few more inches of cold
steel&mdash;was buried in the breast of that abominable spadassin
who had thought to lay so stalwart an enemy low.
</p>

<p>
And, mind you, this would have been exceedingly
satisfactory&mdash;the life of a rascally Spaniard in exchange for a
half-severed wrist&mdash;had not some other rogue of the same
ilk, who happened to be close by, succeeded at that very
instant in delivering a vigorous thrust into the body of
Maître Jehan le Bègue, the faithful friend and companion
of the Sire de Froidmont.  Whereupon Gilles, maddened
with rage, slashed and charged upon the enemy with such
lustihood that for an instant the valiant French troops,
which indeed were sore pressed, rallied about him, and the
issue of the conflict hung once more in the balance.  But
alas! only for a few moments.  The Spaniards, more
numerous and undoubtedly more highly skilled in the
science of arms, soon regained the advantage, and within
a few hours after that, they were driving the Netherlander
and the French helter-skelter before them, having gained
a signal and decisive victory.
</p>

<p>
This all occurred at Gembloux in Brabant, three and more
years before the events which I am about to put on record
in this veracious chronicle, and at the time when the Sire
de Froidmont and his faithful henchman, Jehan&mdash;surnamed
le Bègue because he stuttered and spluttered like a clucking
hen&mdash;happened to be fighting in the Netherlands at the
head of a troop of French Protestants who had rushed to
support the brave followers of Orange against the powerful
armies of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma; and I use
the word 'happened' advisedly, because in these days
the knights and gentlemen of France&mdash;aye, and the marshals
and princes of blood, far finer noblemen and lords than
was the poor Sire de Froidmont&mdash;were wont to fight now
on one side, now on the other&mdash;now on the Catholic side,
hand-in-hand with the Spaniards; now on the Huguenot,
according if they 'happened' to be in good friendship
with the Queen Mother or with the King's favourite, or
with the Protestant Henry of Navarre.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion, and despite his broken wrist, Messire
Gilles de Crohin was the very last to lay down his sword
before the victorious Spaniard; nor is the expression 'lay
down his sword' altogether the right one to use, for the
Sire de Froidmont never did lay down his sword either to
the Spaniards or to any other enemy, either then or on any
other occasion.  But it seems that, in addition to that
half-severed wrist, he had several and sundry wounds about
his body, and all the while that the victorious Spanish army
pursued the Netherlanders even as far as the territory of
the King of France, Messire Gilles lay as one dead, bleeding,
half-frozen, and only sufficiently conscious to curse his own
fate and the disappearance of Maître Jehan le Bègue, the most
faithful servant and most expert henchman, man ever had.
The trouble, indeed, was that Master Jehan was nowhere
within sight.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Now it happened that that memorable night of February,
1578, which followed the grim fight in the valley below
Gembloux, was a very dark one.  Toward eight or nine
o'clock of the evening, Messire Gilles woke from his state
of unconsciousness by feeling rough and unfriendly hands
wandering about his body.  Had I not already told you
that his language was apt to be more forceful than reverent,
I would tell you now that he utilized his first return to
actuality in sitting up suddenly and pouring forth such
a volley of expletives against the miscreants who were
even then trying to divest him of his boots, that, seized
with superstitious fear, these human vultures fled, scattered
and scared, to rally again at some distance from the spot,
in order to resume their nefarious trade with less forcible
interruption.
</p>

<p>
Messire Gilles listened to their scurrying footsteps for
awhile; then with much difficulty, for he was sorely hurt
and bruised, he struggled to his feet.
</p>

<p>
The darkness lay upon the plain and wrapped in its
grim pall all the suffering, all the horror which the fiends
of hatred and of fanaticism had brought in the wake of
this bloody combat.  Silence absolute reigned in the valley,
save for an occasional sigh, a moan, a cry of pain or a
curse, which rose from the sodden ground up to the sombre
firmament above, as if in protest to the God of battles against
so much misery and so much unnecessary pain.
</p>

<p>
Gilles&mdash;accustomed as he was to all these sounds&mdash;shook
himself like a shaggy dog.  Though he was comparatively
a young man still, these sounds had rung in his ears ever
since, as a young lad, he had learned how to fight beside
his father's stirrup leathers, and seen his father fall, wounded
and bruised, in much the same plight as he&mdash;Gilles himself&mdash;was
at this hour.  Nor had the night any terrors for
him.  The groans of dying men no longer stirred his senses,
and only moved his heart to transient pity.  What did
worry Messire Gilles de Crohin, however, was the disappearance
of Maître Jehan.
</p>

<p>
'So long as those hellish body-snatchers do not get hold
of the poor fool!' he sighed dolefully.
</p>

<p>
Just then his ear, trained of old to catch the slightest
sound which might bring a ray of hope at moments such as
this, perceived above the groanings and the sighs the
distant tinkle of a bell.
</p>

<p>
'Now, Gilles, my friend,' he murmured vaguely to
himself, 'collect your scattered senses and find out exactly
where you are.'
</p>

<p>
Dizziness seized him again, and he came down on one
knee.
</p>

<p>
'Jehan, you dog!' he exclaimed instinctively, 'where
the devil are you?'
</p>

<p>
To which summons Maître Jehan was evidently unable
to give reply, and Messire Gilles, very sore and very much
out of humour, once more contrived to struggle to his feet.
The tinkling of that bell seemed more insistent now; his
re-awakened consciousness worked a little more actively.
</p>

<p>
'We fought just below Gembloux,' he reflected.  'The
tinkling which I hear is the monastery bell on the heights
above.  Now, if it will go on tinkling till I have struck the
right direction and see a light in the monastery windows,
I doubt not but that those worthy monks will let me lie
in the kennel of one of their dogs until I can find my way
to a more congenial spot.'
</p>

<p>
From which cynical reflection it can be gathered that
Messire Gilles had not a vast amount of faith in the
hospitality of those good Benedictines of Gembloux; which
doubt on his part is scarce to be wondered at, seeing that
he had been fighting on the side of the heretics.
</p>

<p>
'If only that ass Jehan were here!' he added, with a
final despondent sigh.
</p>

<p>
It was no earthly use for a wounded, half-fainting man
to go searching for another in the darkness on this field
littered with dead and dying.  Gilles, whom a vague instinct
drove to the thought, had soon to give up all idea of it as
hopeless.  The same acute sense of hearing which had
brought to his semi-consciousness the sound of the tinkling
bell, also caused him to perceive through the murky blackness
the presence of the human vultures taking their pickings
off the dead.
</p>

<p>
Gilles shuddered with the horror of it.  He felt somehow
that poor old Jehan must be dead.  He had seen him fall
by his side in the thick of the fight.  He himself was only
half-alive now.  The thought that he might once more
fall under the talons of the body-snatchers filled him with
unspeakable loathing.  He gave himself a final shake in
order to combat the numbness which had crept into his
limbs in the wake of the cold, the faintness and the pain.
Then, guided through the darkness by the welcome
tintinnabulation of the monastery bell, he started to make
his way across the valley.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Why should I speak of that weary, wretched tramp of
a sorely-wounded man, in the dead of night, on sharply-rising
ground, and along a track strewn with dead and dying,
with broken bits of steel and torn accoutrements, on
sodden ground rendered slippery with blood?  Messire
Gilles himself never spoke of it to any one, so why should
I put it on record?  It took him five hours to cover less
than half a league, and he, of a truth, could not have told
you how he did it even in that time.  He was not really
fully conscious, which was no doubt one of God's many
mercies, for he did not feel the pain and the fatigue, and
when he stumbled and fell, as he very often did, he picked
himself up again with just that blind, insentient action
which the instinct of self-preservation will at times give
to man.
</p>

<p>
Whenever he recalled this terrible episode in his chequered
career, it took the form in his brain of a whirl of confused
memories.  The tinkling of the bell ceased after a while,
and the moans which rose from the field of battle were
soon left behind.  Anon only a group of tiny lights guided
him.  They came from the windows of the monastery
on the heights above, still so far&mdash;so very far away.  Beyond
those lights and the stillness&mdash;nothing; neither pain, nor
cold, nor fatigue, only a gradual sinking of sense, of physical
and mental entity into a dark unknown, bottomless abyss.
Then a sudden, awful stumble, more terrible than any that
had gone before, a sharp agonizing blow on the head&mdash;a
fall&mdash;a fall into the yawning abyss&mdash;then nothing more.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Everything that happened after this belongs to the world
of dreams.  So, at any rate, did Messire Gilles aver.  The
sensation of waking up, of opening his eyes, of feeling
sweet-smelling straw beneath his aching body, was, of course, a
dream.  The sense of well-being, of warm yet deliciously
cooling water, and of clean linen upon his wounds was a
dream; the murmur of voices around him was a dream.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Messire Gilles would have thought that they
were realities, because all these sensations, remember, were
not altogether unknown to him.  How many times he had
lain wounded and insensible during his stormy life-career,
he could not himself have told you.  He had oft been tended
by kindly Samaritans&mdash;lay or clerical; he had oft lain on
fresh, clean straw and felt that sense of well-being which
comes of complete rest after dire fatigue.  But what he
had never experienced in his life before, and what convinced
him subsequently that the whole episode had only been
the creation of his fevered fancy, was that wonderful vision
of a white-robed saint or angel&mdash;good Messire Gilles could
not have told you which, for he was not versed in such
matters&mdash;which flitted ever and anon before his weary eyes.
It was the sound of a voice, whispering and gentle, which
was like the murmur of butterflies' wings among a wilderness
of roses; it was the perfume of spring flowers with the
dew fresh upon them which came to his nostrils; it was a
touch like unto the velvety petals of a lily which now and
again rested upon his brow, and above all it was a pair of
deep blue eyes, which ever and anon met his aching ones
with a glance full of gentleness and of pity.
</p>

<p>
Now, although Messire Gilles was quite willing to admit
that some angels might have blue eyes, yet he had never
heard it said that they had a tiny brown mole on the left
cheek-bone&mdash;a mole which, small as it was, appeared like
a veritable trap for a kiss, and added a quaint air of
roguishness to the angelic blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
But then Gilles de Crohin, being a heretic and something
of a vagabond, was not intimately acquainted with the
outward appearance of angels.  Moreover, that wee, tantalizing
mole was far removed from the reach of his lips.
</p>

<p>
'Think you he'll recover, Messire?'
</p>

<p>
Just at that moment Gilles de Crohin could have sworn
that he was conscious and awake; but that whisper, which
suddenly reached his hazy perception, could not have been
aught but a part of his dream.  He would have liked to
pinch or kick himself to see if he were in truth awake, but
he was too weak and too helpless to do that; so he lay
quite still, fearful lest, if he moved, the vision of the
white-robed angel who had just made such tender inquiry after
him, would vanish again into the gloom.  Thus he heard
a reply, gruff and not over tender, which, of a truth, had
nothing dreamlike about it.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, he'll recover soon enough, gracious lady.  These
rascals have tough hides, like ploughing oxen.'
</p>

<p>
Messire Gilles de Crohin, Sire de Froidmont, tried to
move, for he was impelled to get up forthwith in order to
chastise the malapert who had dared to call him a rascal;
but it seemed as if his limbs were weighted with lead&mdash;for
which fact he promptly thanked his stars, since if he had
moved, those heavenly blue eyes would, mayhap, not scan
his face again so anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'Think you he fought on the side of our enemies?'
the dream-voice queried again; and this time there
was an awed, almost trembling tone in its exquisite
music.
</p>

<p>
'Aye,' answered the graft one, 'of that I have no doubt.
Neither psalter nor Holy Bible have I found about his
person, and the gracious lady should not have wasted her
pity upon a spawn of the devil.'
</p>

<p>
'He looked so forlorn and so helpless,' said the
angel-voice with gentle reproach.  'Could I let him lie there,
untended in a ditch?'
</p>

<p>
'How did he get there?' retorted the real&mdash;the human&mdash;voice.
'That is what I would wish to know.  The fighting
took place over half a league away, and if he got his
wounds on the battlefield, I, for one, do not see how he
could have walked to the postern gate and deposited himself
there, just in time to be in your way when you deigned
to pass.'
</p>

<p>
'God guided him, Messire,' said the angel softly, 'so
that you might do one of those acts of goodness and of
charity for which He will surely reward you.'
</p>

<p>
Some one&mdash;a man, surely&mdash;seemed to mumble and to
grumble a good deal after that, until the human voice
once more emerged clearly out of the confused hubbub.
</p>

<p>
'Anyhow, gracious lady,' it said, 'you had best let
yourself be escorted back to your apartment now.  Messire
is already fuming and fretting after you; nor is it seemly
that you should remain here any longer.  The fellow will
do quite well, and I'll warrant be none the worse for it.
He's been through this sort of thing before, my word on
it.  His wounds will heal...'
</p>

<p>
'Even that horrid one across his wrist?' queried the
white-robed saint again.  (Gilles by now was quite sure
that it was a saint, for the tender touch upon his burning
hand acted like a charm which soothed and healed.)
</p>

<p>
'Even that one, gracious lady,' replied the swine who
had dared to speak of the Sire de Froidmont as a 'rascal'
and a 'fellow.'  'Though I own 'tis a sore cut.  The rascal
will be marked for life, I'll warrant.  I've never seen such
a strange wound before.  The exact shape of a cross it
is&mdash;like the mark on an ass's back....  But it'll heal,
gracious lady ... it'll heal ... I entreat you to leave
him to me.'
</p>

<p>
Anger again rose hotly to Messire Gilles' fevered brow,
whereupon everything became more and more confused.
The darkness closed in around him; he could no longer
see things or hear them; he was once more sinking into
the dark and bottomless abyss.  He opened his eyes, only
to see a white-robed vision far, far above him, fading slowly
but certainly into nothingness.  The last thing which he
remembered was just that pair of blue eyes&mdash;the most
luminous eyes he had ever gazed into; eyes which looked
both demure and tantalizing&mdash;oh, so maddeningly tantalizing
with that adorable little mole, which was just asking
for a kiss!
</p>

<p>
And the rest was silence.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
When Gilles de Crohin, Sire de Froidmont, once more
recovered consciousness, it was broad daylight.  The slanting
rays of a genial, wintry sun had struck him full in the
face, and incidentally had been infusing some warmth into
his numbed body.  He opened his eyes and tried to visualize
his position.  It took him some time.  He still felt very
giddy and very sick, and when he tried to move he ached
in every limb.  But he was not cold, and his temples did
not throb with fever.  As he groped about with his right
hand, he encountered firstly the folds of a thick woollen
cloak which had been carefully wrapped around him, and
then, at a foot or so away, a pitcher and a hunk of
something which to the touch appeared very like bread.
</p>

<p>
Messire Gilles paused after these preliminary investigations,
closed his eyes and thought things out.  He had been
dreaming, of that there was no doubt, but he would be
hanged, drawn and quartered if he knew whence had come
the pleasing reality of a cloak, a pitcher and a hunk of
bread.
</p>

<p>
It was some time after that, and when the sun was
already high in the heavens, that he managed to sit up,
feeling the pangs of hunger and of thirst intensified by the
vicinity of that delectable bread.  The pitcher contained
fresh, creamy milk, which Messire Gilles drank eagerly.
Somehow the coolness of it, its sweetness and its fragrance
made his dream appear more vivid to him.  The bread was
white and tasted uncommonly good.  After he had eaten
and drunk he was able to look about him.
</p>

<p>
As far as he could recollect anything, he was lying very
near the spot where he had fallen the day before&mdash;or the
day before that, or a week, or a month ago&mdash;Messire Gilles
was not at all clear on the point.  But here he was, at any
rate, and there were all the landmarks which he had noted
at the time, when first his troop was attacked by the
Spaniards.  There was the clump of leafless shrubs, trampled
now into the mud by thousands of scurrying feet; there
was the group of broken trees, stretching gaunt arms up
to the skies, and beyond them the little white house with
the roof all broken in&mdash;a miserable derelict in the midst of
the desolation.
</p>

<p>
He, Gilles, had been propped up against a broken tree-trunk
which lay prone upon the ground.  Underneath him
there was a thick horse-blanket, and over him the
aforementioned warm cloak.  His cut wrist had been skilfully
bandaged, the wounds about his body had been dressed
and covered with soft linen, and, hidden away under the
trunk, behind where he was lying, there was another loaf
of bread, another pitcher containing water, the limbs of
a roasted capon and a pat of delicious-looking cream cheese.
</p>

<p>
The Benedictine monastery which, from the distant
heights had dominated the field of battle, was on Gilles'
right.  All around him the valley appeared silent and
deserted save by the dead who still lay forgotten and
abandoned even by the human vultures who had picked them
clean.  There were no more dying on the field of Gembloux
now.  Here and there a clump of rough shrubs, a broken
tree with skeleton arms stretched out toward the distance,
as if in mute reproach for so much misery and such wanton
devastation; here and there the crumbling ruins of a wayside
habitation, roofless and forlorn, from which there still
rose to the wintry firmament above, a thin column of smoke.
From somewhere far away came the rippling murmur of
the stream and through it the dismal sound of a dog howling
in this wilderness, whilst overhead a flight of rooks sent
their weird croaking through the humid air.
</p>

<p>
All other sounds were stilled&mdash;the clash of arms, the call
of despair or of victory, the snorting of horses, the cries of
rage and of triumph had all been merged in the mist-laden
horizon far away.  Was it indeed yesterday, or a cycle of
years ago that Gilles de Crohin had lain just here, not far
from this same fallen tree-trunk, a prey to the ghoulish
body-snatchers who, by their very act of hideous vandalism, had
brought him back to his senses?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VI
</h4>

<p>
Later on in the forenoon when, having eaten some of the
capon and the cream cheese, he was able to struggle to his
feet, Gilles started out to look for his friend.
</p>

<p>
Though his thoughts and impressions were still in a state
of confusion, the possible plight of Maître Jehan weighed
heavily on Messire's soul.
</p>

<p>
He remembered where Jehan had fallen right down in
the valley, not far from the edge of the stream and close
to the spot where he, Gilles, had received that terrible blow
upon his wrist, and had then lashed out so furiously into
the Spaniard in his wrath at seeing his faithful henchman
fall.
</p>

<p>
And there indeed he found him&mdash;stark naked and
half-frozen.  The human vultures had robbed him even of his
shirt.  The search had been long and painful, for in
addition to his own weary limbs, Messire Gilles had dragged
the horse-blanket and the warm cloak about with him.
He knew, alas! in what plight he would find Master
Jehan&mdash;if indeed he were fortunate enough to find him at all;
and he had also carried the pitcher half-filled with water
and had thrust bread and capon into his breeches' pocket.
Now that he had succeeded in his quest, he laid the blanket
and the cloak over the inanimate body of his friend, moistened
poor Jehan's cracked lips with the water, then he laid
down beside him and fell into another swoon.
</p>

<p>
Sometime during that long and bitter day he had the
satisfaction of hearing Master Jehan both groan and curse.
He was able to feed him with bread and to ply him with
water; and when the night came the two of them rolled
themselves up in the one blanket and kept one another
warm and comforted as best they could.
</p>

<p>
It is not my purpose to speak of the vicissitudes, of
the ups and downs which befell Messire Gilles de Crohin
and his faithful Jehan during the next few days and weeks,
whilst they struggled from a state of moribundity into
one of life and vigour once again, tended and aided now
by one Samaritan, now by another; helped, too, by a
piece of gold which Messire Gilles most unaccountably
found in the inner pocket of his doublet.  He swore that
he had no idea he had ever left one there.
</p>

<p>
All that I desire to remind you of is that, as soon as he
could again struggle to his feet, he went on another quest&mdash;one
that to him was only second in importance to the search
for his friend.  It was a quest connected with the Benedictine
monastery up yonder on a spur of the Ardennes.  Messire
Gilles now was quite conscious enough to remember that
the monastery had been his objective when, sorely wounded
and aching in every limb, he had started on a weary tramp
which had culminated in an exquisite dream.  To the
monastery, therefore, he meant to go, for he wished to
ascertain if somewhere near by there was a postern gate, beside
which angels with blue eyes and perfumed hands were wont
to pass, and to minister to the sick and to the weary.
Messire Gilles, you perceive, trusted a great deal to intuition
first and then to observation.  He was quite certain in
his own mind that if there was a postern gate he would
come across it; and he was equally certain that in the
rough grass or the scrub close by he would recognize traces
of a sorely-wounded man falling headlong against a very
hard wall, and the footsteps of the kindly Samaritan who,
at the aforesaid angel's bidding, had carried him to shelter.
</p>

<p>
As for the angel, it was obvious of course, that such
celestial beings did not walk and would not therefore leave
imprints upon the sordid earth; still, even so, Messire
Gilles clung to the vain hope that he would see tiny
footprints somewhere, such as fairies make when they dance
in a ring, and that from the very ground there would arise
the perfume of spring flowers when the dew is fresh upon
them in the morn.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VII
</h4>

<p>
I may as well put it on record here and now that Gilles
de Crohin, Sire de Froidmont, after having tramped along
half a league or more, came upon the purlieus of the
Benedictine monastery of Gembloux, which is famed far and wide,
and that after much exploration he did discover a postern
gate which was let into a high stone wall.  But neither
in front of that gate, nor anywhere near it, were there
any traces of Samaritans, of angels or of a wounded man.
The ground round about that gate had at some time or
another been strewn with sand and raked over very smoothly
and evenly, after which the humid air and the rain had
had their way with it.
</p>

<p>
Messire Gilles uttered a comprehensive oath.  Then he
turned on his heel and went his way.

<br /><br />
  HOW A NOBLE PRINCE PRACTISED THE GENTLE<br />
  ART OF PROCRASTINATION<br />
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Now, all that which I have related occurred during the
month of February in the year 1578&mdash;three years
and more ago.
</p>

<p>
After which I come to my story.
</p>

<p>
We will leave the subject of Messire Gilles' dream, an it
please you; we will even leave that gallant if somewhat
out-at-elbows gentleman in the tap-room of the only
hostelry of which the little town of La Fère could boast, where
he must needs wait for the good pleasure of no less a
personage than François Hercule, Duke of Alençon and of
Anjou&mdash;usually styled '<i>Monsieur</i>'&mdash;who was own brother
to His Very Christian Majesty, King Henry III of France,
and whom Gilles de Crohin, Sire de Froidmont, was serving
for the nonce.
</p>

<p>
M. le Duc d'Alençon and d'Anjou was closeted upstairs
with the Queen of Navarre, that faithful and adoring sister
who had already committed many follies for his sake, and
who was ready to commit as many more.  What she saw
to adore and worship in this degenerate and indolent scion
of the princely house of Valois, in this foppish profligate
devoid alike of morals and of valour, no historian has ever
been able to fathom.  That he had some hidden qualities
that were as noble as they have remained unknown to
tradition, we must assume from the very fact that Marguerite,
Queen of Navarre, one of the most brilliant women of that
or any epoch and the wife of one of the most dazzling and
fascinating men of his day, lavished the resources of her
intellect and of her sisterly love upon that graceless
coxcomb.
</p>

<p>
Picture her now&mdash;that beautiful, clever woman&mdash;full of
energy, of vitality and of burning ambition, pacing the
narrow room in the humble hostelry of a second-rate city,
up and down like some caged and exquisite wild animal,
the while that same fondly-adored brother sat there silent
and surly, his long legs, encased in breeches of delicate
green satin, stretched out before him, his not unattractive
face, framed in by an over-elaborate ruffle, bent in moody
contemplation of his velvet shoes, the while his perfumed
and slender hands fidgeted uneasily with the folds of his
mantle or with the slashings of his doublet.
</p>

<p>
On the table before him lay a letter, all crumpled and
partly torn, which Marguerite had just thrown down in
an access of angry impatience.
</p>

<p>
'By all the saints, François,' she said tartly, 'you would
provoke an angel into exasperation.  In Heaven's name,
tell me what you mean to do.'
</p>

<p>
<i>Monsieur</i> did not reply immediately.  He stretched out
his legs still further before him; he shook his mantle into
place; he smoothed down the creases of his satin breeches;
then he contemplated his highly polished nails.  Marguerite
of Navarre, with flaming cheeks and blazing eyes, stood
by, looking down on him with ever-growing irritability
not unmixed with contempt.
</p>

<p>
'François!' she exclaimed once more, evidently at the
end of her patience.
</p>

<p>
'Gently, my dear Margot; gently!' said <i>Monsieur</i>,
with the peevishness of a spoilt child.  'Holy Virgin, how
you do fume!  Believe me, choler is bad for the stomach
and worse for the complexion.  And, after all, where is
the hurry?  One must have time to think.'
</p>

<p>
'Think!  Think!' she retorted.  ''Tis two days since
M. d'Inchy's letter came and he sends anon for his answer.'
</p>

<p>
'Which means,' he argued complacently, 'that there
is no cause to come to a decision for at least half an hour.'
</p>

<p>
An angry exclamation broke from Marguerite's full lips.
</p>

<p>
'My dear Margot,' said the Duke fretfully, 'marriage
is a very serious thing, and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He paused, frowning, for his sister had burst into ironical
laughter.  'I am well aware,' he resumed dryly, 'that
you, my dear, look upon it as a cause for levity, and that
poor Navarre, your husband&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I pray you, dear brother,' she broke in coldly, 'do
not let the pot call the kettle black.  'Tis neither in good
taste nor yet opportune.  M. d'Inchy will send for his
answer anon.  You must make up your mind now, whether
you mean to accept his proposal or not.'
</p>

<p>
Again <i>Monsieur</i> remained silent for awhile.  Procrastination
was as the breath of his body to him.  Even now
he drew the letter&mdash;every word of which he probably knew
already by heart&mdash;towards him and fell to re-reading it
for the twentieth time.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Marguerite of Navarre, biting her lips and almost crying
with vexation, went up to the deep window embrasure and,
throwing open the casement, she rested her elbow on the
sill and leaned her cheek against her hand.
</p>

<p>
The open courtyard of the hostelry was at her feet, and
beyond it the market-place of the sleepy little town with
its quaint, narrow houses and tall crow's foot gables and
curious signs, rudely painted, swinging on iron brackets
in the breeze.  It was early afternoon of a mild day in
February, and in the courtyard of the hostelry there was
the usual bustle attendant upon the presence of a high
and mighty personage and of his numerous suite.
</p>

<p>
Men-at-arms passed to and fro; burghers from the tiny
city, in dark cloth clothes and sombre caps, came to pay
their respects; peasants from the country-side brought
produce for sale; serving-men in drab linen and maids
in gaily-coloured kerchiefs flitted in and out of the hostelry
and across the yard with trays of refreshments for the retinue
of M. le Duc d'Anjou and of Madame la Reynede Navarre,
own brother and sister of the King of France.  Indeed, it
was not often that so great a prince and so exalted a lady
had graced La Fère with their presence, and the hostelry
had been hard put to it to do honour to two such noble
guests.  Mine host and his wife and buxom daughters
were already wellnigh sick with worry, for though Madame
la Reyne de Navarre and M. le Duc, her brother, were very
exacting and their gentlemen both hungry and thirsty,
not one among these, from <i>Monsieur</i> downwards, cared
to pay for what he had.  And while the little town seethed
with soldiery and with loud-voiced gentlemen, the unfortunate
burghers who housed them and the poor merchants
and peasants who had to feed them, almost sighed for the
Spanish garrisons who, at any rate, were always well-paid
and paying.
</p>

<p>
Down below in the courtyard there was constant jingling
of spurs and rattle of sabres, loud language and ribald
laughter; but when the casement flew open and the Queen
of Navarre's face appeared at the window, the latter, at
any rate, was at once suppressed.  In the shade and across
a narrow wooden bench on which they sat astride, a couple
of gentlemen-at-arms were throwing dice, surrounded by
a mixed and gaping crowd&mdash;soldiers, servants, maids and
peasants&mdash;who exchanged pleasantries while watching
the game.
</p>

<p>
Marguerite looked down on them for a moment or two,
and an impatient frown appeared between her brows.  She
did not like the look of her brother's 'gentlemen,' for they
were of a truth very much out-at-elbows, free of speech
and curt of manner.  The fact that they were never paid
and often left in the lurch, if not actually sold to their
enemies by <i>Monsieur</i>, accounted, no doubt, for all the
laxity, and Marguerite swore to herself even then, that if
ever her favourite brother reached the ambitious goal for
which she was scheming on his behalf, one of his first acts
of sovereignty should be to dismiss such down-at-heel,
out-at-elbows swashbucklers as were, for instance, Messire
Gilles de Crohin and many others.  After which vow
Marguerite de Navarre once more turned to her brother,
trying to assume self-control and calmness which she was
far from feeling.  He appeared still absorbed in the
contemplation of the letter, and as he looked up lazily and
encountered her blazing eyes, he yawned ostentatiously.
</p>

<p>
'François!' she burst out angrily.
</p>

<p>
'Well, my dear?' he retorted.
</p>

<p>
'M. le Baron d'Inchy,' she continued more quietly, 'hath
taken possession of Cambray and the Cambrésis and driven
the pro-Spanish Archbishop into exile.  He offers to deliver
up the Cambrésis and to open the gates of Cambray to you
immediately, whilst M. le Comte de Lalain will hand you
over, equally readily, the provinces of Hainault, of Flanders
and of Artois.'
</p>

<p>
'I know all that,' he muttered.
</p>

<p>
'You might be Duke of Hainault and Artois,' she went
on with passionate enthusiasm.  'You might found a
new kingdom of the Netherlands, with yourself as its first
sovereign lord&mdash;and you hesitate!!!  Holy Joseph!  Holy
Legions of Angels!' she added, with a bitter sigh of
pent-up exasperation.  'What have I done that I should be
plagued with such a nincompoop for a brother?'
</p>

<p>
François d'Alençon and d'Anjou laughed and shrugged
his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'The provinces are worth considering,' he said coolly.
'Cambray is attractive, and I would not object to the
Duchies of Artois and Hainault, or even to a Kingdom of
the Netherlands.  But...!'
</p>

<p>
'Well?' she broke in testily.  'What is the "but"?'
</p>

<p>
He sighed and made a sour grimace.  'There is a bitter
pill to swallow with all that sugar,' he replied.  'You
appear to be forgetting that, my very impetuous sister!'
</p>

<p>
It was Marguerite's turn to shrug her pretty shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'Bah!' she said contemptuously.  'A wife!  You call
that a bitter pill!  Jacqueline de&mdash;&mdash;what is her name?'
</p>

<p>
<i>Monsieur</i> referred to the letter.
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline de Broyart,' he said dryly.
</p>

<p>
'Well!  Jacqueline de Broyart,' she continued, more
composedly, 'is said to be attractive.  M. d'Inchy says
so.'
</p>

<p>
'A merchant must praise the goods which he offers for
sale,' remarked Monsieur.
</p>

<p>
'And even if she be ill-favoured,' retorted Marguerite
dryly, 'she brings the richest duchies in the Netherlands
and the influence of her name and family as her marriage
portion.  Surely a kingdom is worth a wife.'
</p>

<p>
'Sometimes.'
</p>

<p>
'In this case, François,' urged Marguerite impatiently.
Then, with one of those sudden changes of mood which
were one of her main charms, she added with a kind of gentle
and solemn earnestness: 'You in your turn appear to forget,
my exasperating brother, that 'tis I who have worked for
you, just as I always have done heretofore, I who made
friends for you with these loutish, ill-mannered Flemings,
and who prepared the way which has led to such a brilliant
goal.  Whilst you wasted your substance in riotous living
in our beloved Paris, I was half-killing myself with ennui
in this abominable Flemish climate, I was drinking the
poisonous waters of Spa so as to remain in touch with the
governors of all these disaffected provinces and insidiously
turning their minds towards looking for a prince of the house
of France to be their deliverer and their ruler.  Now my
labours are bearing fruit.  Don John of Austria is more
hated throughout the Netherlands than he was before my
coming hither, the provinces are more wearied of the
Spanish yoke&mdash;they are more ready to accept a foreign ruler,
even though he be a Catholic to boot.  You have now but
to stretch a hand, and all the golden harvest prepared by
me will fall into it without another effort on your part save
that of a prompt decision.  So let me tell you, once and
for all, Monsieur my brother, that if you refuse that golden
harvest now, if you do not accept the Baron d'Inchy's
offer, never as long as I live will I raise another finger to
help you or to advance your welfare.  And this I hereby
do swear most solemnly and pray to the Virgin to register
my vow!'
</p>

<p>
The Duke, unaccustomed to his charming sister's earnestness,
had listened to her without departing from his sullen
mood.  When she had finished her tirade he shrugged his
shoulders and yawned.
</p>

<p>
'How you do talk, my dear Margot!' he said coolly.
'To hear you one would imagine that I was an incorrigible
rogue, an immoral profligate and a do-nothing.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, what else are you?' she retorted.
</p>

<p>
'A much maligned, overworked prince.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed, and despite her choler a look of genuine
affection crept into her eyes as she met the reproachful
glance of the brother whom she loved so dearly, and whose
faults she was always ready to condone.
</p>

<p>
'By the Mass!' quoth he.  'You talk of having worked
and slaved for me&mdash;and so you have, I'll own&mdash;but, far
from leading a dissipated life in Paris the while, I toiled
and slaved, intrigued and conspired, too&mdash;aye, and risked
my life a hundred times so that I might fall in with your
schemes.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' she broke in with a good-natured laugh.  'Let
us be just, Monsieur my brother.  You allowed others to
toil and slave and intrigue and conspire, and to risk their
life in your cause&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
''Tis you are unjust, Margot,' he retorted hotly.  'Why,
think you then, that I was arrested by order of my brother
the King, and thrown into the dungeon of Vincennes&mdash;&mdash;?'
</p>

<p>
'You would not have been arrested, my dear,' said
Marguerite dryly, 'if you had not chosen to be arrested.'
</p>

<p>
'The King, our brother, does not approve of your schemes,
my Margot.'
</p>

<p>
'He is the dog in the manger,' she replied.  'Though
Flanders and Hainault and the Netherlands are not for
him, he does not wish to see you a more powerful prince
than he.'
</p>

<p>
'So, you see&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But you knew,' she broke in quickly, 'you knew four
and twenty hours before the order of your arrest was issued
that the King had already decided on signing it.  You had
ample time for leaving Paris and joining me at Spa.  Six
precious months would not have been wasted&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Well!  I escaped out of Vincennes as soon as I could.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes!' she retorted, once more fuming and raging, and
once more pacing up and down the room like a fretful
animal in a cage.  'Procrastination!  Time wasted!
Shelving of important decisions!...'
</p>

<p>
He pointed leisurely to the letter.
</p>

<p>
'There's no time lost,' he said.
</p>

<p>
'Time wasted is always lost,' she argued.  'The tone
of M. le Baron d'Inchy is more peremptory this time than
it was six months ago.  There is a "take it or leave it"
air about this letter.  The provinces are waxing impatient.
The Prince of Orange is rapidly becoming the idol of the
Netherlands.  What you reject he will no doubt accept.
He is a man&mdash;a man of action, not a laggard&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But I am not rejecting anything!' exclaimed <i>Monsieur</i>
irritably.
</p>

<p>
'Then, for God's sake, François&mdash;&mdash;!'
</p>

<p>
Marguerite de Navarre paused, standing for a few seconds
quite still, her whole attitude one of rigid expectancy.
The next moment she had run back to the window.  But
now she leaned far out of the casement, heedless if the men
below saw the Queen of Navarre and smiled over her eagerness.
Her keen ears had caught the sound of an approaching
troop of men; the clatter of horses' hoofs upon the
hard road was already drawing perceptibly nearer.
</p>

<p>
'Messire Gilles!' she called out impatiently to one of
the dice-throwers, who was continuing his game unperturbed.
</p>

<p>
In a moment the man was on his feet.  He looked up
and saw the Queen's pretty face framed in by the
casement-window; and a pretty woman was the only thing on God's
earth which commanded Gilles de Crohin's entire respect.
Immediately he stood at attention, silhouetted against
the sunlit market-place beyond&mdash;a tall, martial figure,
with face weather-beaten and forehead scarred, the record
of a hundred fights depicted in every line of the sinewy
limbs, the powerful shoulders, the look of self-assurance
in the deep-set eyes and the strong, square jaw.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
There was nothing very handsome about Messire Gilles
de Crohin.  That portrait of him by Rembrandt&mdash;a mere
sketch&mdash;done some years later, suggests a ruggedness of
exterior which might have been even repulsive at times,
when passion or choler distorted the irregular features.
Only the eyes, grey and profound, and the full lips, ever
ready to smile, may have been attractive.  In a vague way
he resembled the royal master whom he was serving now.
The features were not unlike those of François, Duc
d'Alençon et d'Anjou, but cast in a rougher, more powerful
mould and fashioned of stouter clay.  The resemblance is
perhaps more striking in the picture than it could have
been in the original, for the Duke's skin was almost as
smooth as a woman's, his hair and sparse, pointed beard
were always exquisitely brushed and oiled; whereas
Gilles' skin was that of a man who has spent more nights
in the open than in a downy bed, and his moustache&mdash;he
did not wear the fashionable beard&mdash;was wont to bristle,
each hair standing aloof from its neighbour, whenever
Messire Gilles bridled with amusement or with rage.
</p>

<p>
Then, again, Gilles looked older than the Duke, even
though he was, I think, the younger of the two by several
years; but we may take it that neither his cradle nor his
youth had been watched over with such tender care as
those of the scion of the house of France, and though
dissipation and a surfeit of pleasure had drawn many lines
on the placid face of the one man, hard fighting and hard
living had left deeper imprints still on that of the other.
Still, the resemblance was there, and though Gilles' limbs
indicated elasticity and power, whereas those of the Prince
of Valois were more slender and loosely knit, the two men
were much of a height and build, sufficiently so, at any
rate, to cause several chroniclers&mdash;notably the Queen of
Navarre herself&mdash;to aver that Gilles de Crohin's personality
ofttimes shielded that of <i>Monsieur</i>, Duke of Anjou and of
Alençon, and that Messire Gilles was ofttimes requisitioned
to impersonate the master whom he served and resembled,
especially when any danger at the hand of an outraged
husband or father, or of a hired assassin lurked for the
profligate prince behind a hedge or in the angle of a dark
street.  Nor was that resemblance to be altogether wondered
at, seeing that the de Froidmonts claimed direct descent
from the house of Valois and still quartered the Flower
o' the Lily on ground azure upon their escutcheon, with
the proud device: 'Roy ne suys, ne Duc, ne Prince, ne
Comte; je suys Sire de Froide Monte.'[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>]  They had indeed
played at one time an important part in the destinies of
the princely house, until fickle Fortune took so resolutely
to turning her back upon the last descendants of the noble
race.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap02fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap02fn1text">1</a>] 'Am neither King, nor Duke, nor Prince, nor Count; am Sire
de Froide Monte.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Marguerite of Navarre was too thoroughly a woman not
to appreciate the appearance of one who was so thoroughly
a man.  Gilles de Crohin may have been out-at-elbows,
but even the rough leather jerkin which he wore and the
faded kerseymere of his doublet could not altogether mar
a curious air of breeding and of power which was not in
accord with penury and a position of oft humiliating
dependence.  So, despite her impatience, she gazed on Gilles
for a moment or two with quick satisfaction ere she
said:
</p>

<p>
''Tis Monseigneur d'Inchy's messenger we hear, is it
not, Messire?'
</p>

<p>
'I doubt not, your Majesty,' replied Gilles.
</p>

<p>
'Then I pray you,' she added, 'conduct him to my
brother's presence directly he arrives.'
</p>

<p>
And even whilst the sound of approaching horsemen
drew nearer and nearer still, and anon a great clatter upon
the rough paving stones of the courtyard announced their
arrival, Marguerite turned back into the room.  She ran
to her brother's chair and knelt down beside him.  She
put fond arms round his shoulders and forced him to look
into her tear-filled eyes.
</p>

<p>
'François,' she pleaded, with the tenderness of a doting
mother.  '<i>Mon petit</i> François!  For my sake, if not for
yours!  You don't know how I have toiled and worked
so that this should come to pass.  I want you to be great
and mighty and influential.  I hate your being in the
humiliating position of a younger brother beside Henri,
who is so arrogant and dictatorial with us all.  François,
dear, I have worked for you because I love you.  Let me
have my reward!'
</p>

<p>
<i>Monsieur</i> sighed like the spoilt child he really was, and
made his habitual sour grimace.
</p>

<p>
'You are too good to me, Margot,' he said somewhat
churlishly.  'I would you had left the matter alone.  Our
brother Henri cannot live for ever, and his good wife has
apparently no intention of presenting him with a son.'
</p>

<p>
'Our brother Henri,' she insisted, 'can live on until
you are too old to enjoy the reversion of the throne of
France, and Louise de Lorraine is still young&mdash;who knows?
The Duchies of Artois and Hainault and the Sovereignty
of the Netherlands to-day are worth more than the vague
perspective of the throne of France mayhap ten or a dozen
years hence&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And my marriage with Elizabeth of England?' he
protested.
</p>

<p>
'Elizabeth of England will never marry you, François,'
she replied earnestly.  'She is too fanatical a Protestant
ever to look with favour on a Catholic prince.  She will
keep you dangling round her skirts and fool you to the top
of her bent, but Milor of Leycester will see to it that you do
not wed the Queen of England.'
</p>

<p>
'If I marry this Flemish wench I shall be burning my
boats&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What matter?' she retorted hotly, 'if you enter so
glorious a harbour?'
</p>

<p>
There was nothing in the world that suited <i>Monsieur's</i>
temperament better than lengthy discussions over a decision,
which could thereby be conveniently put off.  Even now
he would have talked and argued and worn his sister's
patience down to breaking point if suddenly the corridor
outside had not resounded with martial footsteps and the
jingling of swords and spurs.
</p>

<p>
'François!' pleaded Marguerite for the last time.
</p>

<p>
And the Duke, still irresolute, still longing to procrastinate,
gave a final sigh of sullen resignation.
</p>

<p>
'Very well!' he said.  'Since you wish it&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I do,' she replied solemnly.  'I do wish it most earnestly,
most sincerely.  You <i>will</i> accept, François?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'You promise?'
</p>

<p>
Again he hesitated.  Then, as the footsteps halted
outside the door and Marguerite almost squeezed the breath
out of his body with the pressure of her young strong arms,
he said reluctantly: 'I promise!'  Then, immediately&mdash;for
fear he should be held strictly to his word&mdash;he added
quickly: 'On one condition.'
</p>

<p>
'What is that?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'That I am not asked to plight my troth to the wench
till after I have seen her; for I herewith do swear most
solemnly that I would repudiate her at the eleventh hour&mdash;aye,
at the very foot of the altar steps, if any engagement
is entered into in my name to which I have not willingly
subscribed.'
</p>

<p>
This time he spoke so solemnly and with such unwonted
decision that Marguerite thought it best to give way.  At
the back of her over-quick mind she knew that by hook or
by crook she would presently devise a plan which would
reconcile his wishes to her own.
</p>

<p>
'Very well,' she said after an almost imperceptible
moment of hesitation.  'It shall be as you say.'
</p>

<p>
And despite the half-hearted promise given by the
arch-procrastinator, there was a look of triumph and of joy on
Queen Marguerite's piquant features now.  She rose to
her feet and hastily dried her tears.
</p>

<p>
There was a rap at the door.  Marguerite seated herself
on a cushioned chair opposite her brother and called out
serenely: 'Enter!'
</p>

HOW A CLEVER WOMAN OUTWITTED AN OBSTINATE MAN
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
The door was thrown open and Messire Gilles de Crohin,
Sire de Froidmont, stood at attention upon the
threshold.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur le Baron d'Inchy's messenger, is it not,
Messire?' asked Marguerite of Navarre quickly, even
before Gilles had time to make the formal announcement.
</p>

<p>
'Messire de Montigny has arrived, your Majesty,' he
replied.  'He bears credentials from Monseigneur the
governor of Cambray.'
</p>

<p>
'Messire de Montigny?' she said, with a frown of
puzzlement.  'In person?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, your Majesty.'
</p>

<p>
'Has he come with a retinue, then?' broke in <i>Monsieur</i>
with his wonted peevishness.  'There is no room in the
city.  Already I have scarce room for my men.'
</p>

<p>
'Messire de Montigny is alone, Monseigneur,' replied
Gilles de Crohin, 'save for an equerry.  He proposes to
return to Cambray this night.'
</p>

<p>
<i>Monsieur</i> uttered a fretful exclamation, but already
Marguerite had interposed.
</p>

<p>
'We cannot,' she said curtly, 'keep Messire de Montigny
on the doorstep, my dear brother.  And you must remember
that I have your promise.'
</p>

<p>
'Holy Virgin!' was <i>Monsieur's</i> only comment on this
timeful reminder.  'Was ever man so plagued before by a
woman who was not even his mistress, Gilles!' he added
peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
'François!' admonished his sister sternly.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Mon Dieu</i>, my dear!' he retorted.  'May I not speak
to Gilles now?  Gilles, who is my best friend&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Messire de Montigny is in the corridor,' she broke in
firmly.
</p>

<p>
'I know!  I know!  Curse him!  I only wished to order
Gilles&mdash;my best friend, Gilles&mdash;not to leave me in the lurch;
not to abandon me all alone between an impetuous sister
and a mulish Fleming.'
</p>

<p>
'François!' she exclaimed.  'What folly!'
</p>

<p>
'Gilles must remain in the room,' he declared, 'during the
interview.'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!' she affirmed hotly.  'Messire de Montigny
might not like it.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I'll not see him&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Marguerite de Navarre was on the verge of tears.  Vexation,
impatience, choler, were wellnigh choking her.
</p>

<p>
'Very well!' she said at last, with a sigh of infinite
weariness.  'I pray you, Messire,' she added, turning to
Gilles, 'introduce Monseigneur le Baron d'Inchy's messenger
and remain in the room, as <i>Monsieur</i> bids you, during the
interview.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Messire de Montigny was a short, stout, determined-looking
gentleman who, very obviously, despite his outward
show of deference to a scion of the house of France, had
received his instructions as to the manner in which he was
to deal with that procrastinating and indolent prince.  He
had clearly come here resolved to be firm and not to yield
an inch in his demands, nor to allow any further delay in
the negotiations wherewith he had been entrusted.
</p>

<p>
But with François, Duc d'Alençon et d'Anjou, a promise
given was not of necessity a promise kept.  No one knew
that better than the sister who adored him, and whose
quasi-maternal love for him was not wholly free from
contempt.  Therefore, all the while that Messire de Montigny
was paying his devoirs to <i>Monsieur</i> and to herself, all the
while that the preliminary flummery, the bowings and the
scrapings, the grandiloquent phrases and meaningless
compliments went on between the two men, Marguerite of
Navarre was watching her brother, noting with a sinking
of the heart every sign of peevish fretfulness upon that weak
and good-looking face, and of that eternal desire to put
decisions off, which she knew in this case would mean the
ruin of all her ambitious plans for him.  At times, her
luminous dark eyes would exchange a glance of understanding
or of appeal with Gilles de Crohin who, silent and
apparently disinterested, stood in a corner of the room
quietly watching the comedy which was being enacted before
him.  Marguerite de Navarre, whose sense of the ridiculous
was one of her keenest attributes, could well appreciate how
a man of Gilles' caustic humour would be amused at this
double-edged duel of temperaments.  She could see how,
at <i>Monsieur's</i> perpetual parryings, Gilles' moustache would
bristle and his deep-set eyes twinkle with merriment; and
though she frowned on him for this impertinence, she could
not altogether blame him for it.  There certainly was an
element of farce in the proceedings.
</p>

<p>
'I have come for Monseigneur's answer,' Messire de
Montigny had declared with uncompromising energy.  'My
brother de Lalain and M. d'Inchy cannot, and will not,
wait!'
</p>

<p>
'You Flemings are always in such a devil of a hurry!'
Monsieur had said, with an attempt at jocularity.
</p>

<p>
'We have endured tyranny for close upon a century,
Monseigneur,' retorted de Montigny curtly.  'We have
been long-suffering; we can endure no longer.'
</p>

<p>
'But, Holy Virgin, Messire!' exclaimed the Duke fretfully,
'ye cannot expect a man to risk his entire future in the turn
of a hand.'
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur le Baron d'Inchy had the honour to send a
letter to Monseigneur two months ago,' rejoined the other.
'The Provinces have fought the whole might of Spain and
of Don Juan of Austria on their own initiative and on their
own resources, for the recovery of their ancient civil and
religious liberties.  But they have fought unaided quite
long enough.  We must have help and we must have a
leader.  The Prince of Orange has his following in Holland.
We in the Cambrésis, in Hainault and Artois and Flanders
want a sovereign of our own&mdash;a sovereign who has power
and the might of a great kingdom and of powerful alliances
behind him.  'Our choice has fallen on <i>Monsieur</i>, Duc
d'Alençon and d'Anjou, own brother to the King of France.
Will he deign to accept the sovereignty of the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and give them the happiness
and the freedom which they seek?'
</p>

<p>
With a certain rough dignity Messire de Montigny put one
knee to the ground and swept the floor with his plumed hat
ere he pressed his hand against his heart in token of loyalty
and obeisance.  Marguerite de Navarre's beautiful face
became irradiated with a great joy.  Her fine nostrils
quivered with excitement and she threw a look of triumph
on Messire Gilles, who had, in his appearance just then,
the solemnity of a Puck&mdash;and one of encouragement on
the beloved brother.  But <i>Monsieur</i> looked as sullen and
as gloomy as he had done before.  If there was a thing on
this earth which he hated more than any other, it was a
plain question which required a plain answer.  He was
furious with Messire de Montigny for having asked a plain
question, furious with his sister for looking triumphant,
and furious with Gilles for seeming so amused.
</p>

<p>
So he took refuge in moody silence, and Messire de Montigny,
with a flush of anger on his round face, quickly rose
to his feet.  Even to one less keenly observant than was
the clever Queen of Navarre, it would have been obvious
that all these obsequious marks of deference, these
genuflexions and soft words were highly unpalatable to the envoy
of Monseigneur le Baron d'Inchy, governor of the Cambrésis.
They were proud folk, these Flemings&mdash;nobles, burgesses
and workers alike&mdash;and it had only been after very mature
deliberation and driven by stern necessity that they had
decided to call in a stranger to aid them in their distress.
The tyranny of the Spaniards had weighed heavily upon
them.  One by one they saw their ancient privileges wrested
from them, whilst their liberty to worship in accordance
with the dictates of their conscience was filched from them
under unspeakable horrors and tyrannies.  They had fought
on doggedly, often hopelessly, loth to call in outside aid
for fear of exchanging one oppressor for another, and a
while ago they had a goodly number of victories to their
credit.  Orange had freed many provinces, and several cities
had driven the Spanish garrisons from out their gates.
M. le Baron d'Inchy had seized Cambray and the Cambrésis
and driven the Catholic Archbishop into exile.  Flemish
governors were established in Hainault, Brabant, in Artois
and in Flanders; the Dutch were the masters in Holland,
Zeeland and Frise&mdash;a splendid achievement!  For, remember
that these burghers and their untrained bands were
pitted against the finest military organization of the epoch.
</p>

<p>
But lately, the Spaniards, alarmed at these reverses, had
sent fresh troops into the Netherlands, and Alexander
Farnese, Duke of Parma, their most distinguished soldier, had
obtained signal victories over the war-wearied Dutch and
Flemish troops.  Since Orange had suffered a signal defeat
at Gembloux three years ago several cities had fallen back
once more under the Spanish yoke.  It was time to call in
foreign aid.  On the one hand, Elizabeth of England had
given assurances of money and of troops; on the other,
Marguerite of Navarre had made vague promises in the
name of the Duc d'Alençon.  A Catholic prince was a bitter
pill to swallow for these staunch Protestants, but when
d'Inchy offered <i>Monsieur</i> the sovereignty of the Netherlands,
with immediate possession of the Cambrésis, of Hainault,
Artois and Flanders, he had first of all insisted&mdash;respectfully
but firmly&mdash;on certain guarantees: the guarantee which to
<i>Monsieur's</i> fastidious taste was like a bitter pill in the sugary
offer&mdash;a Flemish wife and a Protestant to boot&mdash;one who
would hold the new sovereign lord true to his promise to
uphold and protect the reformed faith.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
"I hate being forced into a marriage!" <i>Monsieur</i> repeated
for the third time, as he cast lowering looks upon the bowed
head of M. de Montigny.
</p>

<p>
'There is no question of force, Monseigneur,' rejoined the
latter firmly.  'M. d'Inchy, speaking in the name of our
provinces, had the honour to propose a bargain, which
Monseigneur will accept or reject as he thinks fit.'
</p>

<p>
'But this Jacqueline&mdash;er&mdash;Jacqueline&mdash;&mdash;?' queried
Monsieur disdainfully.
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline de Broyart, Dame de Morchipont, Duchesse et
Princesse de Ramose, d'Espienne et de Wargny,' broke in
Messire de Montigny with stern pride, "is as beautiful and
pure as she is rich and noble.  She is worthy to be the
consort of a King.'
</p>

<p>
'But I have never seen the lady!' argued <i>Monsieur</i>
irritably.
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline de Broyart,' retorted de Montigny curtly,
'cannot be trotted out for Monseigneur's inspection like a
filly who is put up for sale!'
</p>

<p>
'Who talks of trotting her out?' said <i>Monsieur</i>.  '<i>Mon
Dieu</i>, man!  Can I not even see my future wife?  In
matters of beauty tastes differ, and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You will admit, Messire,' here interposed Marguerite
quickly, seeing that at <i>Monsieur's</i> tone of thinly-veiled
contempt frowns of anger, dark as thunder-clouds, were
gathering on Messire de Montigny's brow.  'You will admit
that it is only just that my brother should see the lady
ere he finally decides.'
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline, Madame la Reyne,' riposted de Montigny
gruffly, 'is wooed by every rich and puissant seigneur in
four kingdoms.  Princes of the blood in Germany and Austria
and Spain, noble lords of England and of France are at her
feet.  She is a mere child&mdash;scarce nineteen years of
age&mdash;but she has a woman's heart and a woman's pride.  She is
my cousin's child; d'Inchy and my brother are her guardians.
They would not allow an affront to be put upon her.'
</p>

<p>
'An affront, Messire?' queried Marguerite coldly.  'Who
spoke of an affront to the Duc d'Alençon's future wife?'
</p>

<p>
'If Monseigneur sees the child,' argued de Montigny
stiffly, 'and then turns against her, she is quite old enough
to look upon that fact as an affront.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil take you for a stiff-necked Fleming, Messire!'
quoth the Duke angrily.
</p>

<p>
'Then Monseigneur refuses?' was de Montigny's calm
retort, even though his rough voice was shaking with
suppressed choler.
</p>

<p>
'No, no, Messire!' once more broke in Marguerite hastily.
'Did Monseigneur say that he refused?'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur seems disinclined to accept,' rejoined de
Montigny.  'And so much hesitation is a slur cast upon
the honour of a noble Flemish lady who is my kinswoman.'
</p>

<p>
'Believe me, Messire,' said Marguerite gently and with
unerring tact, determined to conciliate at all costs, 'that
we of the house of Valois hold all honour in high esteem.
Meseems that you and my brother do but misunderstand one
another.  Will you allow a woman's wit to bridge over the
difficulty?'
</p>

<p>
'If you please, Madame,' replied de Montigny stiffly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Marguerite de Navarre gave a short sigh of satisfaction.
One look of warning only did she cast on her brother, and
with an almost imperceptible movement of finger to lip
she enjoined him to remain silent and to leave the matter
in her hands.  François d'Anjou shrugged his shoulders
and smothered a yawn.  The whole matter was eminently
distasteful to him, and gladly would he have thrown up
the promised throne and be rid of all these serious questions
which bored him to tears.
</p>

<p>
De Montigny stood erect and stern; his attitude remained
deferential, but also unyielding.  He was deeply offended
in the person of the child who in his sight stood for all that
was most noble and most desirable in the Netherlands.  The
indifference with which the offer of such a brilliant alliance
had been received by this Prince of France had angered the
stiff-necked Fleming beyond measure.  But Marguerite,
feeling the difficulties around her, was now on her mettle.
None knew better than she how to make a man unbend&mdash;even
if he be a bitter enemy, which de Montigny certainly
was not.
</p>

<p>
'Messire,' she said with that gentle dignity which became
her so well, 'I pray you be not angered with my brother.
He has had much to worry him of late.  Indeed, indeed,'
she continued earnestly, 'his heart is entirely given over to
your magnificent country and he is proud and honoured
to have been chosen by you as your future Sovereign
Lord.'
</p>

<p>
But to this conciliating harangue de Montigny made no
reply, and Marguerite resumed, after a slight pause.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps you do not know, Messire, that the King of
France, our brother, hath not such goodwill towards his
kindred as they would wish, and that, fearing that <i>Monsieur</i>
would be overproud of your offer and would nurture further
ambitious plans, he did order <i>Monsieur's</i> arrest, thereby
causing us much delay.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, your Majesty,' replied de Montigny curtly, 'I knew
all that.  But the offer hath been made to Monseigneur
now&mdash;and I still await his answer.'
</p>

<p>
'His answer is yes, Messire!' said Marguerite firmly.
</p>

<p>
'A grudging "yes," forsooth,' quoth de Montigny with an
impatient shrug of the shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'An eager "yes," an you'll believe me,' retorted Marguerite.
'All that he asks is to see the noble Dame Jacqueline
de Broyart and to pay her his devoirs ere he is formally
affianced to her.'
</p>

<p>
'Hang it all!' quoth <i>Monsieur</i> resolutely.  'You cannot
expect a man to wed a woman whom he has never seen!'
</p>

<p>
'A man in Monseigneur's position,' retorted de Montigny
gruffly, 'must do many things which humbler folk can afford
to leave undone, and I have explained my objections to
that plan; so that if Madame la Reyne hath none other to
offer&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Nay! but I entreat you to listen to me, Messire,' urged
Marguerite with exemplary patience.  'And you, François,'
she added, turning to her brother, who at de Montigny's
last words had muttered an angry oath under his breath,
'I beg that you will let me unfold my plan ere you combat
it.  Messire,' she continued earnestly, once more addressing
the Flemish lord, 'let me assure you again that I both
understand and appreciate your objection and, on my soul
I never dreamed of suggesting that so noble and great a
lady as Madame Jacqueline de Broyart should, as you justly
remark, be trotted out for the inspection of Monseigneur,
like a filly which is put up for sale.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, then&mdash;&mdash;?' retorted de Montigny.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me, Messire,' she interposed irrelevantly, 'how old
exactly is Madame Jacqueline?'
</p>

<p>
'Not yet twenty,' he replied.  'But I do not see&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You will in a moment,' quoth she with a smile.  'Twenty,
you said?'
</p>

<p>
'Not quite.'
</p>

<p>
'And beautiful, of course?'
</p>

<p>
'Ask the men of Hainault and of Flanders,' was his proud
reply.  'They will tell you how beautiful she is.'
</p>

<p>
'Twenty&mdash;not quite&mdash;and beautiful,' said Marguerite of
Navarre slowly.  'And of a romantic turn of mind, shall we
say, as young girls so often are?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, as to that,' replied de Montigny with a puzzled
frown, 'I dare swear that she hath a romantic turn of mind.
She certainly would not allow herself to be offered up for
sale like a bundle of goods.  Therefore&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Easy, easy, Messire!' urged the Queen gently.  'I
entreat you to reply to my questions without choler.  Are we
not both striving to find a way out of an impasse which might
wreck the very welfare of your country and Monseigneur
d'Inchy's most cherished scheme?'
</p>

<p>
De Montigny sighed impatiently.  'You are right,
Madame la Reyne,' he said grudgingly.  'I pray you continue.
I'll not lose my temper again.  My word on it.'
</p>

<p>
'You were about to assure me, Messire,' resumed
Marguerite gently, 'that Madame Jacqueline is as romantic
as she is beautiful.'
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline has been spoilt and adulated,' replied de
Montigny, determined to speak calmly.  'Poets have
dedicated their verses to her.  Musicians have sung her
praises&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And love-sick swains have died of love for her, or sighed
impassioned tirades beneath her casement-window,' concluded
Marguerite, with a smile which was so winning that, despite
himself, after a moment or two, it found a pale reflex in de
Montigny's stern face.
</p>

<p>
'Who should know better than the Queen of Navarre,'
he retorted, with a crude effort at gallantry, 'the power
which beauty wields over all men?'
</p>

<p>
'Very well, then, Messire,' quoth she gaily.  'Listen to
my plan, for I swear 'tis a good one, since it will marry your
pride to my brother's hesitation.  I propose that <i>Monsieur</i> le
Duc d'Anjou shall first approach Madame Jacqueline under
an assumed name.  She hath never seen him&mdash;he is totally
unknown in these parts; his incognito could therefore be
easily kept up.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't quite understand,' muttered de Montigny with a
frown.
</p>

<p>
'You will in a moment,' she rejoined.  'I propose, then,
that <i>Monsieur</i> shall enact a part&mdash;the part of an unknown
and noble prince who hath become secretly enamoured of
Madame Jacqueline.  I would suggest that he should appear
before her closely masked and begin his part by sighing
dolefully beneath her casement-window.  Thus, at the
outset, Madame Jacqueline, being what she is&mdash;romantic
and not yet twenty&mdash;will feel an interest in this unknown
swain.  Her curiosity will be aroused, and she will not be
loth to grant him the interview for which he will have sighed
and begged in all humility.'
</p>

<p>
'But that is sheer folly, Madame!' broke in de Montigny,
who had been at great pains to check his growing truculence.
</p>

<p>
'Folly?' she queried blandly.  'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;' he argued gruffly.
</p>

<p>
'You promised on your honour, Messire,' she admonished
gaily, 'that you would not again lose your temper.'
</p>

<p>
'But the folly of it!'
</p>

<p>
'Again I ask you&mdash;why folly?'
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline is not a foolish child.  She is not like to
be taken in by so transparent a comedy.'
</p>

<p>
'It will not be transparent, Messire.  Under my guidance
the comedy will be exceedingly well acted.  Madame
Jacqueline will never know that her love-sick swain is
the Duke of Anjou.'
</p>

<p>
'Then 'tis greater folly still!'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, that I swear it is not!' retorted Marguerite de
Navarre hotly.  'Your Jacqueline is not twenty&mdash;she is
proud and beautiful and romantic.  Well! give her some
romance and she'll thank you for it presently on her knees.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;&mdash;' protested de Montigny.
</p>

<p>
'Is not the whole thing simplicity in itself?' she broke
in eagerly.  'The fame of Madame Jacqueline's beauty hath
spread far and wide; what more rational than that a noble
prince&mdash;too insignificant or too poor to enter the lists for
her hand&mdash;should choose a romantic method to approach
her?  After all, what are we all striving for?  That
<i>Monsieur</i> shall see the lovely Jacqueline without her knowing
that he proposes to woo her.  If, in addition to that, we
cause the two young people to fall in love with one another,
we shall have done well; whilst, on the other hand, if, after
having seen her, <i>Monsieur</i> retires from the candidature, the
susceptibilities of the Flemish nation and of Madame
Jacqueline will have been safeguarded.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'The unknown prince can vanish as mysteriously as he
came.  The story can reach Madame Jacqueline's ear that
he was found killed by some other jealous swain outside
her garden-gate.'
</p>

<p>
'Folly, Madame!  Folly, I say!' protested de Montigny,
perhaps a shade less forcibly than he had done before.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, then, 'tis a blessed folly, Messire, which oft
outweighs counsels of wisdom.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! but me no more buts, Messire!  Ye cannot bring
forth one objection which I cannot easily combat.  Think
on it!  A romantic girl, whose life will be brightened by
this pretty adventure!'
</p>

<p>
'Perchance&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Perchance what?'
</p>

<p>
'She fall in love with the unknown swain.'
</p>

<p>
'So much the better, when she discovers he is her future
lord.'
</p>

<p>
Then, as de Montigny really appeared to be struggling
between consent and refusal, and doubt, anger, contempt,
irresolution were alternately depicted in his rugged face,
she continued persuasively:
</p>

<p>
'Think, Messire, how you safeguard your niece's feelings,
her just pride, her maidenly reserve.  <i>Monsieur</i> le Duc
d'Anjou will either himself fall madly in love with Madame
Jacqueline&mdash;in which case you will have added the leaven
of passion to the stodgy dough of matrimony&mdash;or else he'll
withdraw from the candidature, unknown, unsuspected;
and the child will only have one pleasant dream the more
to add to her illusions.'
</p>

<p>
Montigny was yielding.  Who could, indeed, resist for
long the insinuating tongue of Marguerite of Navarre, the
eager glitter of her eyes, the strength of her will and of her
personality.  The sober-minded, stiff-necked and somewhat
slow-witted Fleming felt himself literally swept off his feet
in this whirlpool of adventure and of intrigue, and his
language was not sufficiently glib to meet objection with
objection, to parry or to thrust in this unequal duel of wits.
Perhaps&mdash;had he not desired so passionately the alliance
which he had been sent to conclude, had he been less firmly
convinced that a union with France would prove the salvation
of his people and of the country which he worshipped&mdash;he
might have opposed an obstinate and gruff refusal to
Marguerite's subtle scheme.  But as it was, his resistance
was soon disarmed; she even managed to conquer the
irritation which <i>Monsieur's</i> very personality had aroused in
his mind.
</p>

<p>
'We have not yet heard,' he said at last, 'what Monseigneur
le duc d'Anjou hath to say on the matter.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' <i>Monsieur</i> hastened to say with mock sincerity,
'all that I have to say is that throughout my life I have
from time to time and on many a momentous occasion,
registered on oath that I would never be affianced to a
woman whom I had not previously learned to love.'
</p>

<p>
'You will own, Messire,' broke in Marguerite gently, 'that
this is a laudable sentiment.'
</p>

<p>
Nor did she think it desirable to let Messire de Montigny
know that her unreliable brother had vowed but half an hour
ago that if a wife were thrust upon him now he would, an
he did not like her, repudiate her even at the foot of the
altar.  Shifty and irresponsible in most things, she knew
him well enough to understand that in matters which affected
himself and his desires, he would prove dangerous, obstinate
and cruel.
</p>

<p>
'On my soul!' added <i>Monsieur</i> with well-assumed
earnestness, 'I do assure you, Messire, that I knew nothing
of my sister's project.'
</p>

<p>
'There was no time to put it before you, François,'
rejoined Marguerite.  'It arose in my brain even while you
parleyed together with Messire de Montigny and seemed
unable to come to an understanding.'
</p>

<p>
'Then what says Monseigneur now?' reiterated the
Flemish lord curtly.
</p>

<p>
'Well!' drawled <i>Monsieur</i> in his usual indecisive way,
'I say&mdash;I say that&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'François!' admonished Marguerite sharply.
</p>

<p>
He felt himself driven into a corner, from which procrastination
would no longer free him.  In a manner the proposed
adventure suited his temperament, and in any case it would
help to put off the final and irrevocable decision.  Therefore
he was willing to fall in with it.  Sentimental dalliance was
an art which he knew to his finger-tips, and there was much
in his sister's project which pleased his lazy, pulpy nature.
To sigh beneath a woman's window, to woo a woman's love
with honeyed words beneath a silken mask, to plan secret
meetings and steal to lovers' trysts at dead of night, had
always been an absorbing occupation for this degenerate
prince.  Now he felt de Montigny's stern gaze fixed upon
him and his sister's admonitions rang in his ears.  He knew
that he had worn her love and patience almost to a breaking
thread.  He threw a final appealing look on Gilles de Crohin,
but the latter's glance of amusement appeared as an
encouragement.  Well, Gilles would know!  Gilles would
appreciate!  He, too, loved masks and casement-windows and
fair women, tearful with love.  Gilles also loved fighting,
so he could do that, if any of it barred the way to <i>Monsieur's</i>
comfort and peace.
</p>

<p>
'François!' came once more, appealing yet severe, from
Marguerite of Navarre.
</p>

<p>
'What says Monseigneur?' reiterated de Montigny for the
third time.
</p>

<p>
'I say that you have left me no choice, Messire,' quoth
François due d'Anjou at last.  'It shall be as my sister
desires.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
What was said after this is not much to the point.  Enough
that de Montigny yielded&mdash;very reluctantly, very slowly, be
it admitted&mdash;but still, he did yield, and Marguerite, Queen
of Navarre, was triumphant because she had got her way
and because she would be allowed now to weave one of those
subtle and sentimental plots which was as the breath of
life to her inventive brain.  She was also triumphant because
she felt that nothing now stood in the way of the ambitious
plans which she had framed for her favourite brother.  She
was triumphant because she felt the romance which she
had concocted for his benefit would end in substantial gain
for him&mdash;a richly-dowered wife and a sovereignty as rich
as a crown.  Then, at last, when she had won Messire de
Montigny over absolutely and completely with her ready wit
and her glib tongue, she extended a gracious hand to the
somewhat shamefaced Fleming.  'Ah, Messire!' she said.
'You little realize how much you have done for your country
this day!'
</p>

<p>
'I certainly have sacrificed my sanity and my better
judgment,' he said gruffly.  But he did bend the knee, and
kissed the delicately-perfumed hand.
</p>

<p>
'And Madame Jacqueline will be at Cambray?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'She is at Cambray now,' he replied.
</p>

<p>
'Then <i>Monsieur</i> had best repair thither right away.  You
yourself will be there, Messire?'
</p>

<p>
'Not I, alas, Madame!' he replied.  'After I have seen
my brother and d'Inchy and obtained their consent to this
wild-cat scheme, I join the army of the Prince of Orange at
Utrecht.'
</p>

<p>
'But you'll see that my brother has a safe conduct and
is sure of a welcome from Monseigneur d'Inchy?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  d'Inchy will consent and so will my brother.  They
will make Monseigneur quite welcome,' rejoined de Montigny
with a sigh.  'All of us would do much, Madame, in order
to bring about this alliance, on which we have set our
hearts.'
</p>

<p>
He was as wax now in the hands of this fascinating
intriguer.  In his heart of hearts he knew that sober
reflection would come anon; he knew that it would take much
persuasion ere his brother, and the other sober-minded
Flemings who ruled the destinies of a great nation and of a
rich heiress, would finally consent to these wild and romantic
plans which had found their origin in an imaginative woman's
brain; he knew that, mayhap, when he returned to Cambray,
he would have to argue in his turn as the Queen of
Navarre had argued with him.  But in the meanwhile, now
that he had given in, he was man enough and gentleman
enough to fulfil his share of the bargain loyally and
completely.
</p>

<p>
'That's brave!' exclaimed Marguerite.  'And I entreat
you, lose no time.  <i>Monsieur</i> could start for Cambray this
night.'
</p>

<p>
'Would Monseigneur go alone?' queried de Montigny.
</p>

<p>
'No, no,' broke in the Duke fretfully.  'I could not go
unattended.  Think on it, Messire!  A prince of the house
of France!'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur would not, I presume, enter Cambray
incognito with a retinue of men-at-arms,' retorted the other
with a grim smile.
</p>

<p>
'No! not a retinue,' he rejoined unperturbed.  'I'll have
Gilles with me and a serving-man; that is all.'
</p>

<p>
'Gilles?'
</p>

<p>
'Gilles de Crohin, Sire de Froidmont,' interposed Marguerite,
as with a graceful gesture of the hand she indicated
Gilles, who still stood silent and impassive in the corner of
the room.  'This gallant gentleman is devoted to Monsieur's
service and accompanies him wherever he goes.'
</p>

<p>
De Montigny's sharp, scrutinizing glance swept approvingly
over Gilles de Crohin's martial figure.
</p>

<p>
'Very well then, so be it,' he said.  'I will give a safe
conduct to Monseigneur under any name he will choose to
assume, and one to Messire Gilles de Crohin, Sire de Froidmont,
who will travel as his equerry.  Is that what Madame
la Reyne desires?'
</p>

<p>
'It is!  It is!' cried Marguerite joyfully.  'Ah!' she
added as she directed a reproachful glance on her brother,
'dilatoriness is not a part of your method, Messire de
Montigny!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Mon Dieu</i>, my good Margot!' quoth <i>Monsieur</i> tartly.
'You do not give Messire sufficient time to breathe.'
</p>

<p>
'Who wants to breathe,' she retorted gaily, 'when the
destinies of kingdoms are at stake?  The safe conducts,
Messire!  The safe conducts, I entreat!  Why not sign
them here and now?'
</p>

<p>
She jumped up from her chair, eager, young, full of vitality.
In a moment, with her own dainty hands, she had placed
ink-horn, sand, a quill, a sheet of paper upon the table.
</p>

<p>
'The safe conduct, Messire!' she reiterated excitedly.
'I vow that I'll don male attire and start for Cambray with
my brother this night!'
</p>

<p>
And she would have done it, too, had not prudence
dictated otherwise.  Her fine, clever face, however, was
well known in this part of Belgium.  She had been at
Cambray but a few weeks ago, moving heaven and earth and
stirring up those heavy Flemings to activity on behalf of
her brother.  But she would have loved to be of that
adventurous party.  The conception of it had been born
in her brain; it was her thing, her creation, her child, and
she fretted at the thought that her brother's indolence,
his shiftlessness and indecision might even yet jeopardize
these glorious projects which she had formed.
</p>

<p>
'Sainte Vierge and chorus of angels, grant me patience!'
she murmured as she watched, frowning and fretful, the
deliberate movements of M. de Montigny.  The Duc d'Anjou
chortled quietly to himself.  He loved to see his impetuous
sister fuming over the dilatoriness of another, and now he
gave a low cackle of delight when the Fleming first drew
a chair slowly to the table, then sat down and settled himself
to write.  He next took up the quill pen, examined it,
tested it on his thumb-nail, turned the sheet of paper over
and over.  Obviously he was not very much used to rapid
caligraphy, and Marguerite's temper was oozing out of her
very finger-tips as she watched that quill pen travelling with
ponderous slowness along the paper.
</p>

<p>
'In what name shall I make out the safe-conduct?' he
asked presently.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, ye gods!' exclaimed Marguerite impatiently.  'Any
name, Messire&mdash;or leave the name in blank&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot do that,' rejoined de Montigny deliberately.
'M. d'Inchy, who is governor of the city and of the province,
would not wish it.  And since Monseigneur desires to enter
Cambray incognito&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Any name will do,' she retorted.
</p>

<p>
'Still, I must have one&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Then, in God's name, make out the safe-conduct in the
name of Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont, travelling
with his equerry Messire Gilles de Crohin and with his
serving-man.  Will that satisfy Monseigneur le Baron
d'Inchy?'
</p>

<p>
De Montigny thought the matter over for a moment or
two ere he replied, wholly unperturbed, 'I think so.'
</p>

<p>
And thus did the document stand.  A permit to enter
the City of Cambray was granted to Monseigneur le Prince
de Froidmont, to his equerry Messire Gilles de Crohin and
to his serving-man, by Edmond, Sire de Montigny, acting on
behalf of Roger, Baron d'Inchy, governor of the province
of Cambrésis, and safe conduct was assured them on their
way thither.[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap03fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn1text">1</a>] This document which Messire de Montigny made out and signed
on that memorable occasion is still preserved among the archives
of the City of Cambray.  At any rate, it was still extant in the
spring of 1914, when the writer of this veracious chronicle was
granted a sight of it.  Since then the hordes of the modern Huns
have swept over the fair lands of Belgium and France.  They
may have destroyed these archives as they did so much of what
had historical and romantic interest.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Well! you have your wish, my dear sister,' was the Duc
d'Anjou's sole comment as he saw the look of impatience on
Marguerite's fair face give place to one of triumph and of
joy.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
HOW <i>MONSIEUR</i> KEPT HIS WORD
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
When M. de Montigny&mdash;after much ponderous
leavetaking&mdash;finally took his departure, accompanied
by Messire Gilles de Crohin, it is positively averred that
Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, forgot for a moment her
position and her dignity and danced around the narrow
room like a child who has had its way after much fighting
and arguing.  It is even said that she dragged her dearly-loved
François up from his chair and that, seizing both his
hands, she forced him to join her in a whirl which literally
swept him off his feet, raised a cloud of dust from the old
wooden floor, and finally sent him sprawling and dizzy, and
thoroughly out of temper, up against the table, from whence
he poured a volley of abuse upon his devoted sister.
</p>

<p>
But I have oft marvelled if this story be true, for, of a
truth, there was no one there to witness these events, and
Queen Margot herself never put them on record.  But there
was Messire Gilles, and where he was at the moment I, for
one, cannot say.  He did accompany Messire de Montigny
as far as the courtyard, and saw that noble Fleming ride off
with an obviously heavy heart, after what had only been a
partially successful errand.  We are not going to suppose
that Messire Gilles paused on his way back to the apartments
of his princely master in order to listen at the keyhole.  He
was more like to have kicked open the door with scant
ceremony and seen the young Queen of Navarre dancing a
rigadoon in the middle of the floor with her reluctant
brother.  Certain it is, that anon he did stand there under
the lintel, coughing and spluttering as the dust caught in
his throat, and coughing so loudly, be it said, that the noise
which he made drowned some of <i>Monsieur's</i> most sanguinary
expletives.  The next moment he had once more entered
the room and closed the door behind him; and Marguerite
paused in her mad dance in order to clap her hands gleefully
together.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Messire Gilles!' she exclaimed excitedly.  'Is it not
wonderful?  Is it not great?  All arranged, and both
Monsieur and that tiresome Fleming satisfied!  Is it not a
triumph, I say?'
</p>

<p>
'A triumph, indeed, your Majesty!' replied Gilles with a
grim smile.  ''Tis only our chief actor, methinks, who doth
not look overjoyed.'
</p>

<p>
'I know,' rejoined Marguerite, with a sigh.  'But, then,
Monsieur never really looks pleased.  So I entreat you,
Messire, remain with him now and make all arrangements
for the journey to-morrow.  Nay! 'twere far better you
started this very night, slept and rested at St. Quentin
and arrived at Cambray the day after to-morrow.  I leave
you with Messire Gilles, François,' she added, turning to
Monsieur who, ill-humoured and still growling like a frowsy
dog, was putting his rumpled toilet in order.  'Let him
make all arrangements for your journey.  He is always of
good counsel.'
</p>

<p>
'Good counsel!' muttered <i>Monsieur</i>.  'Good counsel!
I am sick to death of good counsels.  Had I been left to
myself&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing would have happened, <i>c'est entendu</i>,' she riposted
gaily.  'Nay! you'll not damp my ardour again, François;
and you cannot deny that I have satisfied M. de Montigny
whilst keeping my solemn promise to you.  So I leave you
now with Messire Gilles.  The way is prepared.  And,
remember,' she added earnestly, 'that you are pledged to
me as I was to you.  I have fulfilled my share of the bargain.
If you fail me now, I will never look upon your face again!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
As soon as Marguerite de Navarre had gone from the
room, Gilles de Crohin drew a folded missive from inside
his doublet and handed it to Monsieur.
</p>

<p>
'Just came by messenger from Paris,' he said curtly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Monsieur</i> snatched eagerly at the missive.  It had been
carefully folded into a tiny compass, tied with a shell-pink
ribbon and sealed with mauve-coloured wax.  <i>Monsieur</i>
broke the seal and read the letter.  A flush&mdash;which might
have been one of pleasure, of excitement or of anger, or
of all three combined&mdash;spread over his face.  He read the
letter again, and a dark frown appeared between his brows.
Then he looked up into the face of the one faithful friend
whom his many treacheries had not driven from his
side.
</p>

<p>
'Gilles,' he said dolefully, 'I cannot go to Cambray.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought as much, Monseigneur,' replied Gilles dryly.
'That letter is from Madame de Marquette.'
</p>

<p>
'It is, my good Gilles,' sighed <i>Monsieur</i>.  'It is!'  Then
as Gilles said nothing, he added fretfully: 'She had promised
to let me know as soon as Monsieur le Comte, her husband,
would be absent from Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' was Gilles' simple comment.  'And is M. le
Comte de Marquette absent from Paris at this moment?'
</p>

<p>
'Cooling his heels in the dungeons of Vincennes, my good
Gilles,' replied <i>Monsieur</i> lightly.
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' uttered Gilles once more; this time without any
comment.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  I let His Majesty, my brother, know indirectly
of certain doings of Monsieur de Marquette.  I have no
doubt, therefore, that that estimable worthy is incarcerated
at Vincennes by now.'
</p>

<p>
'Under a false charge of conspiracy?'
</p>

<p>
'False?  No!' retorted <i>Monsieur</i>.  'Doth he not conspire
to keep his charming wife a virtual prisoner in his own
palace?'
</p>

<p>
'Therefore he is to be kept a real prisoner under a
denunciation from <i>Monsieur</i> le Duc d'Alençon and d'Anjou,'
riposted Gilles dryly.
</p>

<p>
'Oh! not a denunciation, my good Gilles!' said <i>Monsieur</i>,
wholly unperturbed.  'I only gave His Majesty a hint that
M. de Marquette was not quite so faithful a subject as one
would desire.'
</p>

<p>
'And the hint has landed M. de Marquette in Vincennes
rightly enough.'
</p>

<p>
'Apparently,' concluded <i>Monsieur</i> placidly, as he held
the delicately-scented missive of Madame de Marquette to
his nose.  'So you see, my good Gilles,' he continued after
a slight pause, 'how inconvenient it will be for me to go
a-wooing a ponderous Flemish wench just now.  Madame
de Marquette is so dainty, so exquisite, so&mdash;so&mdash;what shall
I say? ... What would you do, now, Gilles?' he added,
with a sudden change of tone, 'if you were in my shoes?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I, Monseigneur,' quoth Gilles, with a careless shrug
of the shoulders.  'Not being a prince of the blood I would
probably stick to my promise and go and woo the Flemish
wench at Cambray.'
</p>

<p>
'I believe you would, you dog!' retorted <i>Monsieur</i> with
a yawn.  'And then hurry back to Paris, eh, in order to
console Madame de Marquette?'
</p>

<p>
'Possibly, Monseigneur,' concluded Gilles simply.
</p>

<p>
'Well, then, the only difference 'twixt you and me, my
dear Gilles&mdash;that is, 'twixt your moral sentiments and mine&mdash;is
that I'll hie me first to console Madame de Marquette,
and having done that, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Gravely offend the most devoted of sisters, Queen
Marguerite of Navarre,' broke in Gilles quickly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' admitted <i>Monsieur</i>.  'I imagine that dear Margot
will be in one of her most fretting humours when she finds
that I am half-way to Paris instead of to Cambray.  She
hath vowed that if I fail her now in her schemes she'll never
look on my face again.  And she won't&mdash;for at least six
months,' he added peevishly.  'Trust her for that!  Margot
is nothing if not obstinate!  And my chance of getting a
rich wife and some rich provinces of these accursed
Netherlands will have vanished for ever.  Ah, Gilles!  my good
Gilles!' he concluded, with naïve induction.  'You see
what comes of it, if a man allows himself to be overruled by
women!'
</p>

<p>
'Well!' retorted the other with a careless laugh.
'Meseems that Monseigneur hath not much cause to quarrel
with his fate this time.  King of the Netherlands!' he
exclaimed, and gave a long, low whistle of appreciation.
''Tis no small matter&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Bah!' rejoined <i>Monsieur</i> with a shrug of the shoulders.
'To be a king among these dull-witted, slow-going Flemings
is not altogether an enviable existence.  Would you care
for it, Gilles?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I, Monseigneur?' riposted Gilles gaily.  'I have so
few kingly attributes.'
</p>

<p>
'Better to be Duc d'Alençon in Paris, eh, than King in
Antwerp or in Ghent?  Brrr!' added <i>Monsieur</i>, with a
mock shudder.  'Think of the Flemish women, my good
man!'
</p>

<p>
'I have thought of them, Monseigneur,' replied Gilles
dryly, 'once or twice since we came into Flanders.'
</p>

<p>
'Well! and what did you think of them?'
</p>

<p>
'That God has fashioned uglier ones.'
</p>

<p>
'Where?'
</p>

<p>
'In many places&mdash;even in Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'Not often, Gilles.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll grant that, Monseigneur, an you command.'
</p>

<p>
'Now this Jacqueline, for instance&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Madame Jacqueline, Monseigneur?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes!' And Monseigneur sighed.  'I have got to marry
her, Gilles, if I wish for the sovereignty of the Netherlands.'
</p>

<p>
'Messire de Montigny hath been at pains to tell us,
Monseigneur, that Madame Jacqueline is very beautiful&mdash;very
beautiful, an it please you.'
</p>

<p>
'It would please me if she were beautiful.  But have you
ever seen a beautiful Fleming, Gilles?'
</p>

<p>
Gilles de Crohin was silent.
</p>

<p>
'Have you, Gilles?' insisted the Duke.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Monseigneur,' replied Gilles curtly.  'Once.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil you did!  Where?'
</p>

<p>
'In the land of dreams, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'Then it could not have been Madame Jacqueline.  She is
reality, alas!  Ponderous reality, I fear!  I have got to woo
her, Gilles.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'Under a mask and an assumed name.'
</p>

<p>
'No better way hath yet been found for wooing a wench.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall have to sing and sigh beneath a casement, and
by the light of the moon risk breaking my neck in trying to
climb up to a window.'
</p>

<p>
''Twill not be the first time Monseigneur hath done
any of these things, and with a less worthy object to boot.'
</p>

<p>
'But this time, Gilles, I might be so much better employed
in consoling Madame de Marquette for the absence of her
lord.'
</p>

<p>
'Whereas, now, Monseigneur will have to send word back
by the messenger&mdash;who, by the way, still waits below&mdash;that
the denunciation against M. de Marquette was an error, and
that you desire his immediate release.'
</p>

<p>
'Gilles!' retorted <i>Monsieur</i> coolly, 'have you become an
idiot?'
</p>

<p>
'I didn't think so, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'Very well, then, do not talk as one.  M. de Marquette
cannot be better occupied than in cooling his heels at
Vincennes.  I am going to Paris, Gilles, in order to explain
this to a charming grass-widow.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Monseigneur.  When?'
</p>

<p>
'To-night.'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur goes to Paris to-night?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  I have said so.'
</p>

<p>
'And Monseigneur means it?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!  Of course I mean it!  You don't suppose
that I am going to allow that exquisite Madame de Marquette
to pine away in solitude, do you?'
</p>

<p>
'But Madame Jacqueline, Monseigneur?' protested Gilles
de Crohin.  'The crown of the Netherlands&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Madame Jacqueline may go to the devil, Gilles, and the
crown of the Netherlands after her&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But, Madame la Reyne&mdash;&mdash;!'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! that is another matter.  My dear sister can go to
the devil if she likes, but I cannot send her thither.  You
must remain here and explain matters to her, Gilles.'
</p>

<p>
'I, Monseigneur?' exclaimed Gilles, very much crestfallen
at this prospect.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  Not to-night, of course.  To-morrow morning.  I
shall be a long way off by then&mdash;too far for her to run
after me and bring me back like a whipped schoolboy;
which, I doubt not, she were quite capable of doing!  Once
I get to Paris, I'll take care that she does not find me,
and she'll have to pacify these tiresome Flemings as best
she can.'
</p>

<p>
Gilles de Crohin looked down for a moment or two on
the sprawling figure of the master whom he served&mdash;the
long, loose limbs stretched out lazily, the narrow shoulders
decked in exquisite satin, the perfumed beard, the delicate
hands, the full, sensual lips and weak chin and jaw which
characterized this last descendant of the Valois.  But not
a line of his own strong, rugged face betrayed just what
he thought, and after a while he resumed in his dry, quiet
way:
</p>

<p>
'I doubt, Monseigneur, that the tiresome Flemings will
allow themselves to be pacified&mdash;nor will Madame la Reyne
de Navarre, I'm thinking,' he muttered under his bristling
moustache.
</p>

<p>
'She must, and they must, my good Gilles,' riposted
<i>Monsieur</i> airily; and, with a wide gesture of his beringed
hand, he appeared to wave aside all the obstacles which
threatened the even course of his path of pleasure.  '<i>Mordieu</i>,
man!  If you are going to raise difficulties&mdash;&mdash;' he
said.
</p>

<p>
'The difficulties are there, Monseigneur.  I am not raising
them.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, then, you will have to smoothe them down for
me, that's all!  What do I pay you for?' he added roughly.
</p>

<p>
'I was not aware that Monseigneur was paying me for
anything,' replied Gilles good-humouredly; 'or had paid
me anything these three years past.'
</p>

<p>
'Then why do you serve me, I wonder?'
</p>

<p>
'I have oft wondered, too!' rejoined Gilles calmly.
</p>

<p>
'My brother Henri would pay you better; so would my
brother-in-law of Navarre.'
</p>

<p>
'That's just it, Monseigneur.  Since there is not much
fighting to do just now, other princes would pay me for
doing dirty work for them, no doubt.  But, being constituted
as I am, if I have to do dirty work for any one I would sooner
not be paid for doing it.  This may sound curious morality,
but so it is.'
</p>

<p>
The Duke laughed.
</p>

<p>
'Morality?  From you, my good Gilles?'
</p>

<p>
'It does sound incongruous, does it not, Monseigneur?'
said Gilles placidly.  'A soldier of fortune, like myself,
cannot of a truth afford to have any morality.  Mine consists
in forgetting the many sins which I have committed and
leaving others to commit theirs in peace.'
</p>

<p>
'Admirable in sentiment, my friend,' concluded <i>Monsieur</i>,
with a cynical laugh.  'You will, therefore, leave me in
peace to join Madame de Marquette, if I wish?'
</p>

<p>
'How can I prevent it, Monseigneur?'
</p>

<p>
'You cannot.  But you can serve me by conciliating my
sister during my absence.'
</p>

<p>
'I will serve Monseigneur to the best of my ability.'
</p>

<p>
'Very well, then.  I start for Paris this night.'
</p>

<p>
'So Monseigneur hath already deigned to say.'
</p>

<p>
'I will let my sister understand that you and I are
starting for Cambray.  She will be overjoyed.  You will ride
with me as far as Noyon, and then under cover of the darkness
you will return hither.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Monseigneur?'
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow, during the forenoon&mdash;not too early,
remember&mdash;you will seek audience of Her Majesty and explain
to her that unavoidable business caused me to change my
mind at the eleventh hour; that I have gone&mdash;whither you
know not&mdash;but that I shall return within a few weeks, or
a few months, as soon as I have tired of my present business,
and that in the meanwhile I adjure her, as she loves me,
to keep those stodgy Flemings in a good humour.  You
understand?'
</p>

<p>
'I understand, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course, Madame Marguerite will fume and fret&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Of course.'
</p>

<p>
'She will also probably throw books, or a slipper, or a
cushion at your head&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Or the fire-irons, Monseigneur'
</p>

<p>
'But you won't mind that&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'On the contrary, I shall enjoy it.'
</p>

<p>
'The more my sister frets the quicker will her choler be
over.'
</p>

<p>
'The quicker, too, will the furniture of the hostel be
smashed to pieces.'
</p>

<p>
'And when she hath calmed down, you and she can sit
together quietly and make plans for the conciliation of my
future loyal Flemish subjects.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall greatly look forward to so peaceful a <i>tête-à-tête</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Then, that's settled!' concluded <i>Monsieur</i> airily, as he
finally rose from his chair, yawned and stretched.
'<i>Palsambleu!</i> what a day of it I have had!  Own to it, my good
Gilles, I have well deserved a holiday and the company of
Madame de Marquette after all this business and the
scoldings and objurgations of my impetuous sister!'
</p>

<p>
'I doubt not, Monseigneur,' responded Gilles dryly,
'that Fate will, as usual, be kind and give you the full
measure of your deserts.'
</p>

<p>
'Amen to that, my friend.  Now, see to it that we get
to horse within the hour.  I'll to my dear Margot and receive
her embraces and her praises for my readiness.  And,
remember,' he added warningly, just as Gilles, turning on
his heel, was striding towards the door, 'that you will have
to impress it upon Her Majesty most emphatically in your
interview to-morrow that it will be no use her trying to
find out where I am.  Madame de Marquette and I will be
beyond her reach.  Between you and me, my good Gilles,
I know of a cosy nest where&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
But Gilles de Crohin was apparently no longer in a mood
to listen patiently to his Royal master's rigmarole.
</p>

<p>
'What about the safe conduct?' he broke in curtly.
And he pointed to the papers which Messire de Montigny
had been at such pains to complete.
</p>

<p>
'Oh! put it away, my good Gilles,' replied <i>Monsieur</i>
carelessly.  'Put it away!  It will be very handy a month
hence, or two months, or three, when I am ready to go and
woo that very solid Flemish maid.'
</p>

<p>
Without another word, Gilles de Crohin picked up the
safe-conduct, folded it carefully and slipped it into the inner
pocket of his doublet.  Then, after a somewhat perfunctory
obeisance, he strode out of the room.
</p>

<p>
<i>Monsieur</i> listened in complacent silence to the firm
footsteps as they gradually died away down the corridor.
Then he shrugged his shoulders and whistled softly to himself.
</p>

<p>
'A good fellow, that Gilles,' he murmured.  'I wonder
what my dear sister will do to him to-morrow when she
hears&mdash;&mdash;?'

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
  WHAT MARGUERITE OF NAVARRE DID WHEN<br />
  SHE HEARD THE NEWS<br />
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
When Messire Gilles de Crohin sought audience of Her
Majesty the Queen of Navarre on the following
day at noon, she had just finished dressing.  She had been
up betimes, been for a ride in the cool of the early morning;
she had broken her fast with a hearty appetite, for she was
young and full of health and vitality.  All night she had
had happy dreams.  The brother whom she loved, just as
a mother loves her most fractious and most unmanageable
child, had at last been brought to act decisively for himself;
the goal of her ambitions for him was in sight; in a very
few months she&mdash;Marguerite&mdash;would have the satisfaction
of seeing him Sovereign Lord&mdash;King, perhaps&mdash;of one of
the finest countries in Europe, as powerful and more than
was brother Henri, King of France.
</p>

<p>
She woke up happy, gay as a lark, contented in mind
and merry of humour.  After her ride and her breakfast
she had a rest, then she put on a pretty gown, for she was
a beautiful woman and knew the value of clothes.  Her
intention now was to remain in La Fère while her dear brother
was in Cambray and to watch over his interests until after
he had been formally betrothed to Jacqueline de Broyart.
After that, she would proceed to Nerac to rejoin her husband.
</p>

<p>
Having dressed and dismissed her waiting-women,
Marguerite de Navarre sat down beside the open casement-window
in order to indulge in pleasant daydreams.  Five
minutes later, one of her serving-men entered in order to
announce to Her Majesty that Messire Gilles de Crohin,
Seigneur de Froidmont, respectfully begged for an immediate
audience.
</p>

<p>
There are moments in life when to all the senses it appears
as if a blow of sledge-hammer power and weight has suddenly
fallen upon the brain, numbing every thought, every
capability and every sentient action.  Just such a moment was
this one for Marguerite of Navarre.  That simple
announcement&mdash;that Messire Gilles de Crohin desired an
audience&mdash;was the sledge-hammer blow which seemed to crush in
the one instant her entire volition and energy and to leave
her unthinking, spell-bound, a mere breathing, human
machine, alive only by the power of the eyes, which remained
fixed upon the doorway wherein presently she would see
Messire Gilles.
</p>

<p>
It was quite unconsciously that she had intimated to the
serving-man that she would receive Messire de Crohin.
After that, she sat on and gazed upon the doorway and
listened as the familiar footfall resounded along the corridor.
Something had happened, or Gilles would not be here.  He
would be on his way to Cambray with <i>Monsieur</i>.  Strangely
enough, it never occurred to Marguerite of Navarre that
some simple, easily-explained if untoward accident had
brought Messire back to La Fère.  She knew that something
terrible had happened, even before she saw Gilles standing
at attention upon the threshold.
</p>

<p>
But while the serving-man was still within earshot, she
found the courage to say quite quietly and almost naturally:
</p>

<p>
'Enter, Messire, I pray you, and close the door behind
you.  You are right welcome.'
</p>

<p>
Then, as soon as the door was closed, she added rapidly
and in a curious choked and hoarse voice:
</p>

<p>
'My brother?'  And as Gilles made no immediate reply,
she continued: 'He hath met with an accident?  He is
dead?'
</p>

<p>
'No!  No!' protested Gilles quickly.
</p>

<p>
'Then, what is it?' she queried.  'Speak, man, or I die
of terror!'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur le Duc d'Anjou did not go to Cambray last
night, your Majesty,' said Gilles quietly.
</p>

<p>
Marguerite frowned.  She did not understand.  The news
now appeared trivial after what she had feared.
</p>

<p>
'Not gone to Cambray?' she said slowly.  'But I saw
him go&mdash;with you, Messire.'
</p>

<p>
'We started together, your Majesty, and rode together
as far as Noyon.  Then Monseigneur went on his way and I
returned hither.'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur went on his way?  What do you mean?
And why did you go to Noyon, which is not on the way to
Cambray?'
</p>

<p>
Gilles de Crohin sighed with impatience.  But for his
respect for the exalted lady, he would have thought her
strangely dull-witted to-day.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur did not go to Cambray,' he reiterated
slowly, like one who is trying to infuse a lesson into the
mind of a doltish child.  'He hath gone to Paris, on his
way to some spot unknown to any one&mdash;certainly unknown
to me.  He will be absent weeks&mdash;perhaps months.  He
desired your Majesty to try and conciliate Monseigneur le
Baron d'Inchy and the other Flemish lords as best you can.'
</p>

<p>
Marguerite of Navarre listened to Gilles until the end.
Slowly, very slowly, the perception of what had happened
penetrated into her brain.  Her eyes were fixed upon him,
glowing with an intense inward fire.  Gradually her breath
came and went with ever-increasing rapidity.  Her left
hand, which rested on the arm of her chair, gripped the
carving with a more and more convulsive clutch.  Then suddenly,
without a cry or warning, her right hand fastened on a
heavy, unloaded pistol which lay, carelessly flung aside,
upon the table close to her, and she flung it at Gilles de
Crohin's head.
</p>

<p>
He dodged, and the massive weapon struck the door behind
him and fell with a clatter to the floor.
</p>

<p>
'I could kill you,' said Marguerite de Navarre huskily,
'for bringing me this news!'
</p>

<p>
'If killing me would bring Monseigneur back,' riposted
Gilles quietly, 'your Majesty would be more than welcome
to do it.'
</p>

<p>
This sobered her, and she pulled herself together, blushing
to the roots of her hair when she realized that her hand
had already seized upon the small Italian dagger which, in
accordance with the prevailing fashion, she wore fastened
to her girdle.  These were but semi-civilized times, and the
days were not very far distant when the messenger of evil
tidings was slain for his pains.  But now, when Marguerite
de Navarre encountered Gilles de Crohin's quiet,
good-humoured gaze, she dropped the little dagger and laughed
almost shamefacedly.
</p>

<p>
'I ought not to have let him out of my sight,' she said
simply.
</p>

<p>
'It would have been wiser, your Majesty,' rejoined Gilles
with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
'Madame de Marquette sent for him, I suppose.'  Then,
as Gilles made no reply to that, she added with sudden
fierce contempt: 'And you helped him to commit this
treachery?'
</p>

<p>
'Would you have me betray the man who trusts me?'
he retorted.
</p>

<p>
'He ordered you to play the farce of starting for Cambray?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'To throw dust in my eyes?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'To accompany him as far as Noyon?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Then to return hither under cover of darkness?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And to greet me on the morrow with the <i>fait accompli</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Holy Virgin!' she exclaimed.  'That men should be so
base!'
</p>

<p>
Tears of mortification, of humiliation, of wild, passionate
anger, had risen to her eyes.  Heavy sobs choked the words
in her throat.  For once in her life Marguerite of Navarre
felt weak and undone and was not ashamed of her weakness.
She had piloted the chariot of her brother's destiny with
such marvellous success up to the dizzy heights of her own
restless ambition only to see it fall crashing to the ground
through his own treachery.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Messire Gilles!' she cried with bitter reproach;
'if only you had served me as well as you have served my
brother!'
</p>

<p>
'I would give my life in your Majesty's service now,' he
rejoined simply, 'if anything that I could do could retrieve
Monseigneur's folly.'
</p>

<p>
'If anything that you could do could retrieve Monseigneur's
folly?' murmured Marguerite slowly, laboriously, like a
child repeating a lesson.  'Alas! nothing can be done now
to retrieve that, Messire.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Outside, a soft-toned bell struck the midday hour.  The
little market-place beyond the courtyard lay bathed in
wintry sunlight.  Men and women were moving to and fro,
stopping to chat with one another or exchanging a hasty
greeting; men-at-arms jingled their spurs upon the uneven
pavements; burghers in dark cloth surtouts flitted solemnly
across the place.  Marguerite watched with dreamy, unconscious
eyes the pulsating life of the somnolent little city.
With her, even life appeared at a standstill.  With this
hideous treachery on the part of her beloved François, with
this unexpected shattering of all her hopes in sight of goal,
she felt as if she herself no longer existed, as if some other
entity had chased her soul away&mdash;her loving, ambitious,
romantic soul&mdash;and taken possession of her body.
</p>

<p>
Gilles stood by, silent&mdash;looking down on her with infinite
compassion.  He, the poor, homeless, penniless soldier of
fortune, found it in his heart to pity this young and adulated
queen.  He would have liked to help her if he could.  But
the situation was now a hopeless impasse.  The curtain
had rung up upon a brilliant drama of glory and of satisfied
ambition; but the principal actor was not there to play
his part, and the drama <i>must</i> fail for want of him.
</p>

<p>
'Shall I go now, your Majesty?' asked Gilles at last.
</p>

<p>
But she made no reply.  She sat on in the high-backed
chair, looking out upon the world beyond.  There were
happy people out there, contented people.  People who had
humble aspirations, but who saw them fulfilled.  Better far
to long for mere subsistence, to have few and simple desires
and see them satisfied, than to let one's ambition soar to
impossible heights which must for ever remain unattainable.
And Gilles remained standing some distance away from the
Queen, watching a whole world of varied emotions flitting
rapidly over her mobile face.  First came anger and despair,
hot resentment and bitter contempt.  The eyes looked
steely and glittered with a fierce, inward wrath, whilst not
one line of tenderness softened the curve of the closely set
mouth.  At this stage of her grim meditations it was obvious
to the keen watcher that Marguerite de Navarre felt that she
would never quite forgive the dearly loved brother this
culminating act of treachery.
</p>

<p>
Then something of the hardness of the look went, and
gave place to one of utter hopelessness which, to Gilles who
knew her buoyant disposition, appeared quite heartrending.
It were absolutely useless now, that look seemed to say, to
try and redeem so much folly, such black and despicable
cowardice.  And there was the shameful humiliation too,
to endure, the necessary abasement before those stiff-necked
Flemish lords, those proud purists, rigid in their code of
honour.  There was the bitter acknowledgment to come
that a prince of the House of France could so vilely break
his word.
</p>

<p>
But presently, even as the tears of wrath and humiliation
still glistened in Marguerite de Navarre's beautiful eyes, there
crept gradually into her face a strange look of puzzlement.
It came slowly, very slowly, just as if Fate, having struck
her blow, was beginning to relent and to whisper words of
hope.  Frowns came and went between the pencilled brows,
and inaudible whispers seemed to come through the slightly
parted lips.  Then, still quite gradually, a glow of excitement
spread over the face, the eyes shone less sombre, a ray of
light, like unto a faint smile, played round the corners of the
lips.
</p>

<p>
Then Marguerite de Navarre turned her pretty head and
fixed her eyes upon Gilles.  And he who stood by, listening
and watching, heard distinctly that her lips murmured the
two little words: 'Why not?'
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour had gone by.  Both the actors in
this palpitating little interlude had lost count of time&mdash;Gilles
gazing pityingly, almost remorsefully, on the Queen,
and she, thinking, thinking, wrestling with Fate, unwilling
even now to give in.
</p>

<p>
And all the while she was looking on Gilles with a puzzled
frown, whilst her lips kept on murmuring, as if unconsciously:
'Why not?'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
'Messire de Crohin,' said Marguerite of Navarre at last.
'You said just now that you would give your life in my
service if anything that you could do at this hour would
retrieve Monsieur's folly.  Did you mean all that you said,
Messire?'
</p>

<p>
Gilles smiled.  'I am not a Royal prince, Madame,' he
said simply.  'I cannot afford the luxury of playing with
my word.  'Tis all I have.'
</p>

<p>
She sighed and looked on him with those appealing yet
compelling eyes of hers, which had such marvellous power
to bend poor, feeble man to her will.
</p>

<p>
'Oh! but do repeat what you said, Messire,' she said
naïvely.  'If you only knew how I long for an assurance
of fidelity from one who is really a man!'
</p>

<p>
'I do repeat then, your Majesty, what I said before,'
rejoined Gilles solemnly; 'that I would give my life in
your service if aught that I can do will retrieve Monseigneur's
folly.'
</p>

<p>
She seemed to drink in his simple words as if they were
nectar to her soul&mdash;her soul, which was thirsting for loyalty,
for service, for strength and truth.  Then she said quietly:
</p>

<p>
'I'll put you to the test, Messire.'
</p>

<p>
'If your Majesty pleases,' he replied.
</p>

<p>
'I pray you,' she then resumed, speaking very quietly
and with slow but firm emphasis, 'to listen in silence and
to the very end to what I am going to say.  However
surprised or&mdash;or&mdash;unwilling you may feel, do not raise any
objections till after I have told you of the scheme which I
have just evolved in my mind, and which I firmly believe
will yet retrieve our family honour and secure for my brother
the throne of the Netherlands.  God knows,' she added with
a bitter sigh, 'that he hath not deserved that you or I should
still be working for him!  But when a prince of the House
of Valois breaks his word, the shame of it bears upon us all.'
</p>

<p>
She paused, and in accordance with her desire Gilles
remained silent, listening.
</p>

<p>
'Messire Gilles,' resumed Marguerite after awhile.  'There
is, so I am told, Valois blood in your veins.  That blood hath
given you a glibness of tongue, at times wholly out of keeping
with your adventurous temperament.  It has also given
you&mdash;so gossip avers&mdash;that persuasive eloquence which
tickles pleasantly the ear of women.  In temperament
and in bearing Nature hath favoured you more generously
than she did my brother.  This perhaps is the only possible
hitch in the plan which I have devised.'
</p>

<p>
Gilles frowned.  It was his turn now to be exceedingly
puzzled.
</p>

<p>
'It has been arranged, Messire&mdash;and to this the Flemish
lord gave his consent&mdash;that <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou et
d'Alençon shall woo his future wife under a mask&mdash;under
a mask,' she reiterated slowly.  'Ah!' she exclaimed,
seeing that Gilles had suddenly given an involuntary gasp.
'I see that already you understand!  There is something
that you can do, Messire, to retrieve <i>Monsieur's</i> folly.  You
can act the rôle which I had assigned to him.  You can don
a mask and woo Madame Jacqueline from beneath her
casement window.  How oft in the past years have you
impersonated your princely master in a less avowable cause?
How many blows and sabre-cuts have you received on his
behalf whilst he pursued some less worthy adventure?
Nay! you cannot deny that.  I know so much of what
my dear brother would conceal from me.  It can be done,
Messire Gilles,' she added eagerly.  'It can be done, if you
will loyally and faithfully serve me to this end.'
</p>

<p>
She paused, breathless and excited, and with glowing
eyes fixed upon Gilles de Crohin as if to probe his very soul
and to extract from him not only a consent, of which she
was already assured, but the same enthusiasm for her scheme
which she felt herself.
</p>

<p>
'Messire Gilles!' she exclaimed.  'It can be done!
And now, in Heaven's name, I pray you, speak!  I can
endure your silence no longer!'
</p>

<p>
Gilles smiled at her quaint inconsequence.  Then he
passed his toil-worn hand through his rumpled hair.  His
look of utter bewilderment was so ludicrous that, despite
her anxiety, Marguerite could not help but laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Messire Gilles!' she cried.  'If you only knew how
comical you look!'
</p>

<p>
'Comical, Madame?' retorted Gilles with a growl.  'So
would you look comical if you were suddenly confronted
with so wild a proposition!'
</p>

<p>
'Wild, Messire?' riposted the Queen.  ''Tis the Flemish
lords who would be wild if my inventive brain had not
conceived the proposition.'
</p>

<p>
'But, Madame&mdash;&mdash;' protested Gilles feebly.
</p>

<p>
'But, Messire,' retorted the Queen, mimicking the unfortunate
man.  'Tell me,' she added more soberly, 'have you
or have you not impersonated <i>Monsieur</i> before now?'
</p>

<p>
'Well!' murmured Gilles, 'I confess that I...'
</p>

<p>
'There was the affair with Monsieur de Ravache, for
instance,' she continued firmly.  'The sword-thrust which
that invincible duellist received in a certain affair of honour
last June was openly attributed to <i>Monsieur</i>; but those who
were in the know have averred that it was Messire Gilles de
Crohin, and not the Duc d'Anjou, who fought Monsieur de
Ravache that night.'
</p>

<p>
Gilles shrugged his shoulders and Marguerite went on
glibly:
</p>

<p>
'And in the fracas in a low booth outside Arras, when an
irate father and three bellicose brothers vowed vengeance
against the princely lover of an over-trusting wench, was
it indeed <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou who, beneath a mask and
cloak, kept half a dozen sturdy swordsmen at bay for close
on half an hour?  Or was it not rather Messire Gilles de
Crohin who fought single-handed thus valiantly, even while
<i>Monsieur</i>, disguised and furtive, found safety in flight?'
</p>

<p>
'Your Majesty, I protest,' broke in Gilles firmly, 'that
rumour is nearly always a lying jade&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Bah!' quoth Marguerite lightly.  'I'll challenge you to
deny either of these tales on your oath.  And there is the
story of the jeweller's daughter, and that of Madame de
Franqueville.  The latter, I believe, is still under the
impression that M. le Duc d'Anjou is the most ardent lover
and the most chivalrous foe in France and that he wears
about his person all the evidences of a hard and adventurous
life.  But why argue, Messire?' she continued impatiently.
'Even if you had never in your life impersonated the shifty
prince whom you serve, I would ask you to do it now for
his sake as well as for mine own.'
</p>

<p>
'But, in the name of all the saints in the calendar!'
exclaimed Gilles with an air of laughable helplessness, 'how
is it all going to be done?  I shall be seen ... recognized
... the fraud exposed within the first few hours
... and our second state will be distinctly worse than our
first.'
</p>

<p>
'Exposed?' rejoined the Queen coolly.  'Who by?
<i>Monsieur</i> hath never been in Cambray.  Who should be
acquainted with his appearance?  And, moreover, there
will be the mask to ward off any untoward or chance
recognition.'
</p>

<p>
'But hath your Majesty thought of Messire de Montigny?'
retorted Gilles dryly.  'He hath just spent half an hour
in Monseigneur's presence and is not blind, I imagine.  A
mere mask would not deceive him.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!  I thought that you would mention Messire de
Montigny,' riposted Marguerite triumphantly.  'Have you
forgotten that he said he would only just have time to see
his brother and M. d'Inchy in Cambray, as he was on his
way to join the army of the Prince of Orange at Utrecht?'
</p>

<p>
'He may return at any time.'
</p>

<p>
'He may,' said Marguerite calmly.  'I did not say,' she
added with a significant little smile, 'that there would be
no risks, no dangers, connected with the undertaking.  If
you fear to affront them, Messire ... why, there's nothing
more to be said.'
</p>

<p>
Marguerite de Navarre was far too clever not to know that
in uttering the word 'danger' she would be playing her
trump card.  'Gilles' objections were suddenly dissolved
like smoke in thin air.  He laughed and said good-humouredly:
</p>

<p>
'That was a clever move, Madame!  I hated the affair
until you spoke of danger.'
</p>

<p>
'And now?' she queried, smiling.
</p>

<p>
'Now?  Now?' he said.  'I merely repeat: how is it
going to be done?'
</p>

<p>
'In exactly the same manner in which the affair, say, with
Madame de Franqueville was conducted,' she replied.
</p>

<p>
'But there we had an object to attain, Madame&mdash;a none
too avowable one, I own, but still an object.  But here
... suppose I sigh beneath Madame Jacqueline's window
effectually?  Suppose she falls in love with her unknown
swain?  Suppose she grants him an interview?....  We
should still be where we now are!  'Tis Monseigneur who
will have to marry Madame Jacqueline de Broyart&mdash;not I.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not trouble your head about that, good Messire,'
retorted Marguerite dryly.  'We only want to gain time.
You do your wooing; I'll see that <i>Monsieur</i> is there to
wed.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  I know him well enough,' she continued with an
impatient sigh.  'His present caprice&mdash;I suppose it is
Madame de Marquette&mdash;will not last a week.  At the end
of a sennight or less he will come back fawning to me,
satiated, bored and repentant, ready to do anything&mdash;even
to marry Madame Jacqueline blindfolded&mdash;in order to regain
my good graces.  All that we want,' pleaded Marguerite
with a sudden softening of her voice and of her whole
attitude, 'is to gain time&mdash;a few days' time, Messire&mdash;while
I go hunting for my faithless brother.  I cannot go and
tell Monseigneur de Lalain and M. le Baron d'Inchy that
<i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou of the princely House of Valois hath
fled from his obligations.  Those obligations must be fulfilled
at all costs, Messire ... at all costs, you understand?
Nominally, Monsieur must be in Cambray within three days,
and you must keep Madame Jacqueline amused and happy
until I send you word that <i>Monsieur</i> is on his way&mdash;ready
to take your place.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;&mdash;' murmured Gilles again, in a final attempt at
protest.
</p>

<p>
She, however, would not allow him to get in a word
edgewise now.
</p>

<p>
'When Monseigneur arrives,' she went on with eager
volubility, 'you, Messire, will give up your dual rôle, become
once again the one and only Sire de Froidmont.  When
<i>Monsieur</i> appears unmasked before his promised bride, we
must see to it that plenty of padding do supplement his
somewhat narrow shoulders and sunken chest, for Madame
Jacqueline and her entourage will have been accustomed
by then to your broad stature, Messire; but no one will
have seen the face of the masked swain.  Oh, Messire
Gilles!  Messire Gilles!' she exclaimed, clasping her hands
together with a gesture of passionate entreaty.  'With
a little thought, a little care and a little luck, it can all
be done so easily if you will but consent!  Say yes, Messire! and
the prayers of a harassed Queen and a doting sister will
bring blessings down upon your loyal head!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
The tears were in Marguerite de Navarre's eyes as she
extended an appealing hand to Gilles de Crohin.  He, poor
wretch, had not much choice.  His loyalty had been
requisitioned in such terms that he could not refuse.  And,
remember, that Gilles de Crohin, the soldier of fortune, was
nothing if not adventurous.  Deep down in his heart
something was already stirring which tickled his imagination
and fired his ardent blood.  Like a war-horse scenting battle,
he scented excitement, danger, hair-breadth escapes,
sword-thrusts given and received&mdash;all of which was to him the
very essence of life.  And there was something exceedingly
pleasant, too, in the gratitude of this beautiful and
accomplished woman&mdash;a Queen indeed, in the highest acceptance
of the word.
</p>

<p>
Messire Gilles' life had been very dull and dreary of
late.  He had set out once&mdash;very long ago and when he was
a mere lad&mdash;to carve out his own fortune in the world.
Penniless, and bearing a noble name which the penury of
two generations had somewhat tarnished, he dreamed, when
he was still in his teens, that Fate reserved something very
glorious and very wonderful for him.  A decade and more
had gone by since then, and Messire Gilles had found that
the cornucopia of Fate held more thistles than roses for him.
The wars now were so inglorious; the days of chivalry had
gone, never to return.  The princes in high places, whom
adventurers such as he were destined to serve, had nothing
to offer for devoted allegiance save a miserable pittance often
withheld.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, Messire Gilles de Crohin had of late
been heartily sick of life.  The spirit of adventure that
glowed within him was gradually becoming somnolent.  He
felt that even his blood would become sluggish in time if
he dragged on this uneventful existence in the wake of an
indolent and dissolute prince.
</p>

<p>
Then, in the midst of all this dreary dullness, came this
ray of sunshine&mdash;an adventure such as he, Gilles, had not
dreamed of since his boyhood&mdash;an adventure proposed to
him by the fairest lips in Europe&mdash;which would bring all
the excitement with it for which he yearned so passionately.
No wonder that every objection seemed to him all at once
to be futile, every obstacle mere child's play.
</p>

<p>
And Marguerite, keen and clever, saw at once that he
was wavering, just as de Montigny had done yesterday.
Long before either of these two men realized themselves
that they were yielding, she <i>knew</i> that she had gained her
point.
</p>

<p>
'You gave me your word, Messire,' she said gently.
</p>

<p>
'And I'll not go back on it, Madame,' he replied.
</p>

<p>
'Yet you hesitate!'
</p>

<p>
'Your pardon, Madame,' he rejoined with a smile.  'I was
only bewildered.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you consent?' she exclaimed joyfully.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders with his habitual easy-going
good-humour.
</p>

<p>
'Madame gives me no choice,' he said.  'I cannot go back
on my word.'
</p>

<p>
He bent the knee and kissed the gracious hand which was
extended to him.  Marguerite's eyes were still bathed in
tears.
</p>

<p>
'If anything that I can do,' reiterated Gilles de Crohin
solemnly, 'will retrieve Monseigneur's folly I'll do it.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' she riposted gently.  'But 'tis your solemn oath
I want, Messire Gilles.'
</p>

<p>
'My word of honour, Madame,' he retorted bluntly, 'hath
always been found sufficient.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay! your oath!' she insisted, pleading once more.  'A
solemn, binding oath!  One,' she added naïvely, 'which, if
broken, would land you in hell.'  Then, as a sudden scowl
gathered on Gilles' brow, she continued in a tone of sadness
and self-pity: 'Do not be angered, Messire.  I know you
for a loyal gentleman and have no doubt that, to you, your
word is as good as your oath.  But I have been so oft
deceived, so oft befooled, that a man's word of honour hath
lost its value in mine eyes.  Can you blame me, remembering
what I am suffering now?'
</p>

<p>
Gilles' sense of humour saved the situation.  His word
of honour had of a truth never been doubted, but in face
of this sorely outraged woman, he could not take offence.
</p>

<p>
'What oath shall I take,' he queried, with a good-humoured
smile, 'that will satisfy the Queen of Navarre?'
</p>

<p>
'On your immortal soul, Messire,' she said solemnly;
'on your hopes of salvation; on all that you hold most
precious and most dear, swear to me that you will serve
me in this matter as I shall direct you, and until I myself do
release you from this bond.'
</p>

<p>
He drew his cross-hilted sword and held it fixed before
his eyes.  Then he placed his right hand upon the hilt and
said with solemn earnestness: 'I swear.'
</p>

<p>
Marguerite gave a quick sigh of content.  She watched
Gilles with evident satisfaction as he rose to his feet, sheathed
his sword and then stood before her in all his picturesque
ruggedness, a perfect presentment of a man, strong,
reliable&mdash;oh! above all, reliable!!!
</p>

<p>
'Now, Madame,' said 'Gilles finally, 'will you deign to
tell me just what I am to do?'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
For an hour and more after that, these two&mdash;veritable
conspirators now&mdash;sat together, the Queen of Navarre
talking and explaining eagerly and Gilles listening; for of
a truth he was still rather bewildered at the proposition
and at the part which he would have to play in it.  Not that
the rôle itself was unfamiliar to him.  He had played it
often enough, as Marguerite had very shrewdly said, and
in far less avowable causes; but never for any length of
time.  It had been a matter of fighting a duel or meeting
an inconvenient interlocutor; a matter of stepping into
his Royal master's shoes for half an hour or so, and as oft
as not under cover of a dim light.  But now he would have
to sustain the part for days&mdash;weeks, perhaps&mdash;never
forgetting, always on the alert, always fearful lest a word, a
gesture, an inflexion of the voice, should betray him.  And
he had sworn so solemnly on what he held most sacred and
most dear that he would see the business through!  Ye
gods! but it was a hard proposition for a simple-minded
soldier of fortune to tackle!
</p>

<p>
Marguerite of Navarre, however, was for laughing away
every difficulty which stood in her path.
</p>

<p>
'It has got to be done, Messire!' she said more than
once, and with ever-increasing earnestness.  'For the
honour of France and of her Royal House.'
</p>

<p>
She began by giving Gilles more money than he had ever
seen before, taking purse after purse of gold from her private
coffer and watching him as, puzzled and confused, he stowed
these away in the inner pockets of his doublet and breeches.
</p>

<p>
'I haven't earned all this yet,' he muttered ruefully.
</p>

<p>
'You will want it,' she rejoined.  'You are a prince,
remember, and though you will be travelling incognito, you
must live like a prince.'
</p>

<p>
But the question of clothes was the most difficult one
to settle.  Gilles de Crohin possessed none save those in
which he stood up at this moment: a well-worn doublet
of faded kerseymere, a stout jerkin and cloth trunks.  His
hose showed a multiplicity of darns, and his boots, though
stout and solid, were not exactly suited to a lady's
drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
'Time is too short to fashion new ones,' said Marguerite
thoughtfully; 'even if this little town did boast of silken
materials and Court tailors; which it certainly does not!'
</p>

<p>
'It certainly doth appear in the light of an insurmountable
difficulty,' rejoined Gilles with a hopeful sigh.
</p>

<p>
'No difficulty is insurmountable, Messire, when the
honour of France is at stake,' she retorted with a frown.
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What hath <i>Monsieur</i> done with his wardrobe?' asked
Marguerite.  'He always travels with trunk-loads of
frippery.'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur left all his clothes here and most of his
jewellery.  I am to convey them to his house in Paris when
an opportunity occurs.'
</p>

<p>
'Very well,' she rejoined firmly; 'we must find what you
want among them.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;&mdash;' he broke in once more, disconcerted at the
suggestion.
</p>

<p>
'But what?'
</p>

<p>
'The trunks are locked.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll break them open,' she rejoined simply.  'Have no
fear, Messire; I am taking all the responsibility of this
affair upon my shoulders.'
</p>

<p>
'But I cannot strut about in another man's clothes!'
protested Gilles dolefully.
</p>

<p>
'Why not?'
</p>

<p>
'Because ... because ... <i>parbleu!</i> because they would
not fit me!'
</p>

<p>
Marguerite smiled.  Then she threw another admiring
glance on Gilles' massive figure.
</p>

<p>
'My brother is very nearly as tall as you are, Messire,
she said,' even though not quite so broad.  I have two very
skilful seamstresses who will adjust <i>Monsieur's</i> doublets
across your splendid shoulders.  With his love of slashings
and puffings, such alterations are very easily done.'
</p>

<p>
'But the boots&mdash;&mdash;' protested Gilles again.
</p>

<p>
'You have the small foot, Messire,' she replied dryly,
'which you inherit from your Valois ancestor.'
</p>

<p>
'The Lord help me, your Majesty!' he exclaimed piteously.
'You have thought of everything, and I am a puppet in your
august hands.'
</p>

<p>
'Therefore I entreat you not to argue any further,' she
retorted gaily, 'or I shall think that you are repenting of
your bargain&mdash;and of your oath.'
</p>

<p>
Which suggestion caused Gilles to cease from further
protests, even though he did express a hope that Her
Majesty's seamstresses would not make gossip all about the
town that he&mdash;the Sire de Froidmont&mdash;was going to walk
about in another man's clothes.
</p>

<p>
'My women never gossip,' said Marguerite dryly, after
which she abruptly changed the subject.  'And now tell
me,' she said.  'A man like you must have a friend, a
comrade or a servant&mdash;some one, in fact, who would be
faithful and trustworthy.  You will want a companion on
your journey.  Messire, have you such a friend?'
</p>

<p>
'Aye! that I have,' replied Gilles fervently, his whole
face beaming with joy at thought of having his faithful
Jehan with him in this mad expedition.
</p>

<p>
'One who would serve you faithfully?' she continued.
</p>

<p>
'To the death, your Majesty.'
</p>

<p>
'And cleverly?' she insisted.  'You will both have to
keep your wits about you.'
</p>

<p>
Gilles smiled.  'Maître Jehan,' he said, 'hath no wits
to speak of, Madame; but he hath a heart of gold and
muscles of steel.  Nature hath forced him to hold his tongue,
for he stutters like a clucking hen.  He is invaluable for
circumventing an inopportune visitor or misunderstanding
an imperative command.  We have fought side by side these
past ten years and have nearly bled to death or been frozen
to death together before now.  Jehan will do for me what
I would do for you, Madame.'
</p>

<p>
'You are lucky, Messire,' rejoined Marguerite simply, 'to
have such a friend.  And I,' she added, with an engaging
smile,' to have such an one, too.  Maître Jehan shall journey
to Cambray with you as your serving-man.  With his
prowess and your own invincible courage and strength, the
very thought of failure appears treasonable.  Ah, Messire
Gilles!' she continued eagerly, 'I beg of you to cast all
doubts aside!  Have no fear, I entreat you&mdash;no fear of
failure or of gossip!  And, above all, trust me!  Trust me,
Messire, that whatever happens, I will not leave you in the
lurch.  Only trust me!  Trust me!  You shall not suffer
through serving me!  On the faith of Marguerite of
Navarre!'
</p>

<p>
She gave him her hand again, and through tears of emotion
gave him a glance of appreciation and of confidence.  Gilles
had no more resistance left in him; and as he looked into
those lovely eyes which had already played such havoc with
men's wills and with men's hearts, he sighed with resignation
and with only a transient thought for the morrow.  None
knew better than the Sire de Froidmont the exact value of
promises made by princes or by women.  To-day Marguerite
of Navarre's clever mind and warm heart were filled with
enthusiasm for this new scheme of hers; a week hence,
mayhap, she would have thought of something else, and
Gilles&mdash;as like as not&mdash;would indeed be left to bear the brunt
of failure.
</p>

<p>
But these were just the vicissitudes which were wont to
attend the career of a soldier of fortune these days.  A
dazzling prize or a gibbet might await the adventurer at the
end of his goal.  For the nonce, Gilles had sworn to serve
this gracious lady and to redeem the unpardonable folly of
a faithless prince, and with a careless shrug of the shoulders
he left the future in Dame Fortune's hands.
</p>

<p>
'I will give you an autograph letter,' resumed Marguerite
more quietly after awhile, 'for M. le Baron d'Inchy, governor
of Cambray, and one for Maître Julien at the hostelry of
"Les Trois Rois."  These will serve as your credentials in
addition to the safe-conducts which Messire de Montigny
delivered to <i>Monsieur</i>.  You have those, I hope.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Madame,' replied Gilles.  'Monseigneur left them
with me.  If your Majesty deigns to remember, they were
e'en made out in my name.'
</p>

<p>
'In the name of Messire Gilles de Crohin, the equerry and
of Monseigneur le prince de Froidmont!' she exclaimed
gleefully.  'Indeed, I mind it well!  You will not even have
to change your name, Messire; and the title shall be yours,
an' you desire it, when my brother is King of the Netherlands.'
</p>

<p>
Gilles shrugged his shoulders.  'Oh! a title,
Madame...!' he said lightly.
</p>

<p>
'I know!  I know!' she riposted, with the volubility of
intense excitement.  'I know your proud device: "Roy
ne suys, ne Prince, ne Duc, ne Comte.  Je suys Sire de
Froide Monte."  Ah, Messire Gilles! you were fated to
belie that device!  Prince de Froidmont&mdash;'tis no mean
title.'
</p>

<p>
'I prefer that of Friend of the Queen of Navarre,' he said
simply.
</p>

<p>
'You are that indeed, Messire, and more,' she rejoined
solemnly.  'Ah! if my brother were only like you, what
glorious destiny would have been his!'
</p>

<p>
'Our destinies are of our own making, Madame,' he
retorted.
</p>

<p>
'You have started to carve them out for yourself now,
Messire Gilles, on the tablets of my memory.'
</p>

<p>
'Then may God and the Fates favour me!'
</p>

<p>
'The Fates?' she cried gaily.  'Why, you and I have
conquered the Fates, Messire.  Will you deny that they are
our handmaidens now?'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
  WHAT MONSEIGNEUR D'INCHY AND MESSIRE GILLES DE<br />
  CROHIN MUTUALLY THOUGHT OF ONE ANOTHER<br />
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
And three days later, an' it please you, Messire Gilles
presented himself, his safe-conduct and his faithful
Jehan at the Porte de Cantimpré.
</p>

<p>
The safe-conduct being made out in the name of
Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont, his equerry, Messire
Gilles de Crohin, and his serving-man, the absence of one
of the three personages was casually commented on by the
Captain of the Guard.
</p>

<p>
'My equerry hath fallen sick on the way,' explained
Gilles airily.  'He lies at a village inn close by and will
come as soon as may be.'
</p>

<p>
It was at once arranged that whenever the equerry did
present himself at the gate, Monseigneur le Prince de
Froidmont was immediately to be apprised of his arrival so that
he might at once stand guarantee for the man's identity.
Needless to say that no such equerry existed, nor does the
Captain of the Guard appear to have worried his head over
so small a matter.  But, anyway, Gilles now was inside
Cambray, the scene of his coming adventure, and I can
assure you that on this first occasion&mdash;it was late evening
then and a cold, drizzling rain was blurring every outline
of the picturesque city&mdash;Gilles did not stride about the
streets with that careless jauntiness which characterized
his usual demeanour.
</p>

<p>
After some searchings and many wanderings through
the most unfrequented portions of the city, Messire did
finally espy the Rue aux Juifs, at one end of which there
dangled on a ricketty iron bracket a half-obliterated sign
that still bore the legend 'Les Trois Rois' in black paint
on a crimson ground and three dabs of pink paint,
surmounted by dabs of yellowish paint, which might still pass
muster as kingly faces surmounted by their crowns.  Now,
if you remember, the Rue aux Juifs in Cambray is a narrow
street which runs behind the Place aux Bois, and links the
latter with the Porte Notre Dame.  Owing to the elaborate
corbelling of the old houses on either side, it appeared far
narrower in the year 1581 than it does to-day,[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>] and the
hostelry so pretentiously styled 'Les Trois Rois' was of
the humblest description.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn1text">1</a>] In the spring of 1914.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Gilles was satisfied to find it so.  He liked its seclusion
and had never been <i>difficile</i> in the matter of his creature
comforts.  Secrecy and mutual confidence were the greatest
desiderata for the moment in the pursuit of his adventure,
and he knew enough about the exquisite Queen of Navarre
that if any male creature who dwelt within 'Les Trois
Rois' had come within the magic circle of her fascination,
that man would go through fire and water, torture and hell
itself, in order to serve her.
</p>

<p>
So he knocked boldly at the ricketty front door of the
humble hostelry.  A young man, thin and pale, wearing
a long doublet of dark woollen stuff and a black cap above
his scanty yellow hair, opened the door and bade him
welcome.  He had a lanthorn in his hand and held it high
above his head, surveying the stranger with that pathetic
air, half-fear, half-entreaty, wherewith the very poor are
wont to regard those who might bring about a small measure
of change in their misery.
</p>

<p>
Gilles at once presented the letter which Madame la
Reyne de Navarre had given him for his prospective host.
The young man glanced at the latter, recognized the
signature, and at once his almost cadaverous-looking face
became transfigured.  His hollow eyes took on a glow of
joy, his cheeks assumed a warm hue, his long, bony hands
clutched the welcome missive as an idolater might clutch
the relic which he worshipped.
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt that Messire Gilles would be made
welcome&mdash;and right welcome&mdash;in the humble hostelry.
Not only would discretion be assured him, but also unswerving
devotion, of which indeed he might presently stand in
sore need.
</p>

<p>
'My mother,' stammered the youth, after he had recovered
from his primary emotion, 'is bedridden now, alas! but
I will do my best to serve you, Messire, and your henchman,
to the best of my ability.  I will tend you and wait on you,
and whatever this humble abode hath to offer is entirely
at your disposal.  My liege lady commands,' he added,
drawing up his spare frame with the air of a devotee in the
presence of his hero.  'I will obey her in all things!'
</p>

<p>
We will not say that Gilles was exactly gratified to hear
that the hostess of 'Les Trois Rois' was bedridden and
would be unable to attend on him, but it is certain that he
was not grieved.  With this young enthusiast alone to
attend on him and to share the secret of his adventure,
he was as secure from untimely discovery as it was possible
under the circumstances to be.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
At eleven o'clock the next morning, Gilles sent word
round to Monseigneur the governor of the Cambrésis that
he would wait on him within the hour.  Together with this
message he sent the sealed letter wherein the Queen of
Navarre commended her dear brother François, Duc d'Anjou,
to the good graces of Monseigneur the governor.
</p>

<p>
At the hour when the messenger arrived, M. le Comte de
Lalain, who was governor of Flanders and one of d'Inchy's
closest associates, was closeted with the latter in one of the
stately rooms of the Archiepiscopal Palace where M. d'Inchy
had taken up his abode after he had dispossessed the
Archbishop and taken possession of the city.  D'Inchy,
obviously nervy and anxious, quickly dismissed the messenger;
then he turned to de Lalain and, throwing the Queen's
letter across the table to him, he said briefly: 'Well, he
has come!'
</p>

<p>
De Lalain in his turn read the letter through.  Then he
sighed.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' he said.  'He, at any rate, seems determined
to carry the adventure through.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope to God that we have done right,' rejoined d'Inchy.
'The whole thing, now that it is upon us, appears to me
more foolish than ever it did before.'
</p>

<p>
'And there is no drawing back now, unfortunately.'
</p>

<p>
'The whole affair is in God's hands,' quoth d'Inchy
sententiously.
</p>

<p>
'In the hands of an irresponsible and dissolute prince,'
said the other moodily.  'I blame de Montigny for having
consented so readily.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you must blame yourself too, my friend,' retorted
d'Inchy dryly.  'You, too, consented, and so did I....'
</p>

<p>
'I know that well enough!  Like yourself, de Montigny
and I acted for the best, though I for one could even now
with zest strike that Valois Prince in the face for this insult
upon our ward.'
</p>

<p>
But d'Inchy apparently was all for a conciliating attitude
and a cheerful view of the situation.
</p>

<p>
'Do not,' he said lightly, 'let us use grandiloquent words,
my dear de Lalain.  There is no insult in a man's desire to
see the woman whom he is asked to wed.  For the time
being Jacqueline will hold herself aloof.  She will appear
little in public, and then only wearing a mask.  After a
few days, if affairs seem to be shaping to our satisfaction,
we can always allow a certain degree of intimacy.  Jacqueline
is so beautiful that we really run no risk of refusal.
And,' he added with a quick sign of finality, 'in any case we
had no choice.'
</p>

<p>
'Alas, no!' rejoined de Lalain ruefully.  'For of a truth
I cannot bring myself to believe in Orange as the saviour
of the Netherlands.  He thinks that he can rally the
burghers and the mass of the people to his standard.  But
I doubt it.  And if he fails in his present campaign we shall
all fall into a veritable abyss of humiliation and dependence
on those abominable Spaniards&mdash;far worse than ever
before.'
</p>

<p>
'And all our friends think the same, as you well know,
my good de Lalain,' continued d'Inchy firmly.  'An alliance
with a prince of the House of France is safer than a
submission to the leadership of Orange.  We want the help
of France; we want her well-trained armies, her capable
generals, the weight of her wealth and influence to drive
the Spaniards out of our provinces.  Elizabeth of England
promises much but holds little.  She is on the side of Orange.
I am on the side of France.'
</p>

<p>
'So am I, my good d'Inchy,' rejoined de Lalain; 'else
I had never consented to the Queen of Navarre's madcap
scheme.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor I,' concluded d'Inchy with the solemn earnestness
of political fanaticism.  'So why all these misgivings, my
good friend?'
</p>

<p>
'Was it fair to the girl?' murmured the other almost
involuntarily.  'Monsieur is as fickle as he is unprincipled.
Had we the right to toy with a woman's heart&mdash;a young
girl's&mdash;our kinswoman&mdash;&mdash;?'
</p>

<p>
'You wrong Jacqueline by such doubts, my friend.  She
is not a child nor yet an irresponsible girl.  She knows that
her person and her fortune are powerful assets in the future
of her country.  She is a patriot, and will never allow
sentiment to overrule her duty.'
</p>

<p>
Perhaps de Lalain would have liked to continue the
argument.  Obviously his conscience was smiting him a
little now that the curtain had actually rung up on the first
act of the foolish adventure.  The ill-fame of the Valois
prince had preceded him long ago.  De Lalain knew&mdash;and
so did d'Inchy, so did de Montigny&mdash;that <i>Monsieur</i>
was both profligate and faithless.  He, like the others, had
entered into a bargain with one whom they could never
trust.  Was it fair?  Was it just?  Would God's blessing
descend upon the proposed Kingdom of the Netherlands
if its foundations rested on so infamous a base?  And yet
de Lalain, though conscious of that vague feeling of remorse,
had no thought of turning back.  Even now, as a tall,
masked figure appeared under the lintel of the door in the
wake of the usher, and then stepped boldly into the room,
he made a great effort to control his resentment.  Though
his hand ached to drag the mask away from the man's face,
to try and read him eye to eye, his reason re-asserted itself,
re-adjusted his thoughts and his sentiments.  'This,' it
whispered insistently, 'this man who has come to Cambray
masked and disguised, is a prince of the House of France.
If he approve of the beautiful Flemish heiress and consents
to take her for wife, the future of the Netherlands is assured,
even though he were twenty times as base as he is depicted.'
</p>

<p>
And reason gained the victory.  D'Inchy already had gone
a few steps forward in order to greet his exalted visitor.
De Lalain composed himself too, even paid an involuntary
tribute of admiration to that tall and martial-looking figure
which enshrined, so rumour had it, a soul that was both
weak and false.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
And Messire Gilles de Crohin, the penniless soldier of
fortune, the mountebank set to play an unworthy part, was
greeted by these two proud Flemish nobles with all the
respect due to a prince of the House of France.  And indeed
there was nothing mean or humble about his appearance
even though he had come to Cambray with only one man
to serve him, and that man a rough and uncouth soldier
with a ludicrous stutter which would at once have provoked
the gibes of Monseigneur, the governor's servants, but for
the fact that Maître Jehan's fists appeared as hard and
harder than their heads, and that his temper was so hot that
he had already put the first scoffers to flight by the mere
rolling of his eyes.  He was standing at this precise moment
immediately behind his master, and as soon as the usher
had withdrawn and the door been closed, he slipped quite
unostentatiously into the nearest corner and remained there,
with his eyes fixed on Messire like a faithful watch-dog,
silent and keen.
</p>

<p>
The two Flemish lords had also waited until the usher
had disappeared; then only did they make obeisance, with
all the ceremonious empressment which the presence of a
Royal personage demanded.
</p>

<p>
Let us admit at once that Gilles looked magnificent in
Monsieur le Duc d'Anjou's splendid clothes&mdash;doublet and
trunks of fine satin, slashed and puffed after the latest
fashion; hose of Italian silk and short mantle of Genoa
velvet, exquisitely embroidered in dull silver and gold,
the whole of that sombre bottle-green hue specially affected
by <i>Monsieur</i> and a miracle of the dyer's subtle art.  He
had ruffles at neck and wrist of delicate Mechlin lace, wore
a mask with a frill of black lace pendant from it, which
effectually hid the whole of his face, and at his side a rapier
which obviously hailed from Toledo.  Altogether a splendid
prince!  And it was difficult indeed to credit the rumours
which averred that he had undermined his constitution by
high living and drinking and a life of profligacy and excess.
</p>

<p>
He received the greetings of the Flemish lords with just
the necessary measure of gracious condescension, and
through the slits of his mask he was studying with keen
anxiety what might be hidden behind those stolid and
stern faces and the frowning glances wherewith two pairs
of eyes were steadfastly regarding him.
</p>

<p>
D'Inchy waited in dutiful respect till <i>Monsieur</i>, Duc
d'Anjou, was pleased to be seated; then he said:
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur understood, I hope, how it was that we
did not present our respects to you in person.  Such a
ceremony would have set the tongues of our town gossips
wagging more furiously than before.'
</p>

<p>
Already, it seemed that the presence of the stranger
inside Cambray had created some comment.  In these
days, when the Spanish armies swarmed all over the
province, when plots and counter-plots were being constantly
hatched in favour of one political side or another, strangers
were none too welcome inside the city.  There was the
constant fear of spies or of traitors, of emissaries from Spain or
France or England, of treason brewed or brewing, which
might end in greater miseries yet for any unfortunate
province which was striving for its own independence and the
overthrow of Spanish tyranny.  Gilles, listening with half
an ear to Monseigneur d'Inchy's elaborate compliments, was
inwardly marvelling whether spies had not already come
upon his track and would upset the Queen of Navarre's
plans even before they had come to maturity.  He had a
curious and exceedingly uncomfortable sensation of
unreality, as if these two stern-looking Flemings were not
actual personages but puppets moved by an unseen hand
for the peopling of his dreams.  He answered the elaborate
flummeries of the governor with a vague: 'I thank you,
Messire.'  Then he added a little more coherently: 'I
understood everything, believe me, and must again thank
you for acceding to my wishes and to those of my sister,
the Queen of Navarre.'
</p>

<p>
'Our one desire, Monseigneur,' continued d'Inchy stiffly,
and still speaking very deferentially, 'our one desire is to
see the sovereignty of the Netherlands secure in your keeping.'
</p>

<p>
Gilles roused himself.  It was no use and ill policy to
boot to allow that feeling of unreality to dominate his mood
so utterly.  If he let himself drift upon these waves of
somnolence he might, with one unguarded word, betray
the grave interests which had been committed to his care.
</p>

<p>
'That is understood, Messire,' he said dryly.  'Messire
de Montigny put the whole matter before me and before my
sister of Navarre.  We both fell in readily with your schemes.
As for me, you know my feelings in the matter.  I only
asked for delay and consideration ere I pledged myself
irrevocably to so grave an affair.'
</p>

<p>
'And we, equally readily, Monseigneur,' asserted de
Lalain, 'do place ourselves entirely at your service.'
</p>

<p>
After which preliminary exchange of compliments, the
Flemings were ready to discuss the matter in all its
bearings.  All the arguments which had been adduced by de
Montigny when the proposed marriage was being discussed
before the Queen of Navarre, were once more dished up for
the benefit of <i>Monsieur</i>.  Gilles played his part with as much
ease as his want of experience would allow; but he was a
soldier and not a courtier, ill-versed too in the art of guarded
speeches.  He fumed and fretted over all these pourparlers
quite as much and more than <i>Monsieur</i> would have
done, and once or twice he caught sight through the slits
of his mask of certain glances of puzzled wonderment which
passed between the two men at a more than usually rough
retort which had escaped his lips.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour drew its weary length along while the
discussion proceeded, and it was at the very end of that time
that M. le Baron d'Inchy said quite casually:
</p>

<p>
'Of course, you, Monseigneur, will understand that since
you choose to do your wooing under a mask, our ward,
Madame Jacqueline de Broyart, Dame de Morchipont,
Duchesse et Princesse de Ramèse, will not appear in public
either, save also with a mask covering her face.'
</p>

<p>
Now Madame la Reyne de Navarre had not thought of this
eventuality, and indeed if it had truly been <i>Monsieur</i> Duc
d'Anjou who had received this ultimatum, he would
undoubtedly have then and there turned on his heel and left
these mulish Flemings to settle their own affairs as they
wished.  But Gilles had sworn to see the business through.
Left to himself in this difficulty, he was for the moment
puzzled, but never tempted to give up the game.  The two
Flemish lords appeared so determined, and with it all so
pleased, with their counter-stroke, that any kind of
argument would only have ended either in humiliating acquiescence
or in the breaking off of the negotiations then and there.
The latter being of course unthinkable, Gilles thought it
best to take this part of the adventure as lightly as he had
taken the rest.
</p>

<p>
''Tis hard for a man to woo a maid whose face he is not
allowed to see,' he said, by way of protest.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Monseigneur is pleased to jest!' was d'Inchy's
calm rejoinder.  'It was agreed that you should come to
Cambray and see the noble lady who holds in her dainty
hand the sovereignty of the Netherlands for her future
lord; but, as Messire de Montigny had the honour to tell you,
Madame Jacqueline de Broyart is not going to be trotted
out for any man's inspection&mdash;be he King or Emperor, or
Prince&mdash;like a filly that is put up for sale.'
</p>

<p>
'But man&mdash;&mdash;' retorted Gilles, nettled by the Flemish
lord's coolness.
</p>

<p>
'I crave Monseigneur's pardon,' broke in d'Inchy with
perfect outward deference; 'but we must remember that
Monseigneur also is here for inspection.  If Madame
Jacqueline refuses the alliance, neither I nor my co-guardian
would dream of forcing her choice.'
</p>

<p>
'That is understood, Messire,' rejoined Gilles coldly.
'And I have set myself the task of wooing the lady with
ardour, so as to win her affection as well as her hand.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Monseigneur....' protested the Fleming with a
deprecating smile.  'That is hardly the position, is it?
You have reserved unto yourself the right to withdraw.
Well, we arrogate that same right for our ward.'
</p>

<p>
'A just arrogation, Messire,' riposted Gilles.  'But why
the mask?' he added blandly.
</p>

<p>
'If Monseigneur will woo Madame definitely and openly,'
replied d'Inchy firmly, 'she will not wear a mask either.
But then there can be no question of withdrawal if she
consents.'
</p>

<p>
Now, to woo Madame Jacqueline definitely and openly
was just the one thing Gilles could not do.  So there was
the difficulty and there the cunning and subtlety of these
Flemish lords, who had very cleverly succeeded in getting
<i>Monsieur</i> into a corner and in safeguarding at the same
time the pride and dignity of the greatest heiress in Flanders.
Gilles would have given all the worlds which he did not
possess for the power to consult with Madame la Reyne de
Navarre over this new move on the part of the Flemings.
But, alas! she was far away now, flying across France after
her faithless brother, hoping soon to catch him by the tails
of his satin doublet and to drag him back to the feet of the
rich heiress whom that unfortunate Gilles was deputed to woo
and win for him.  And Gilles was left to decide for himself,
which he did with a 'Very well, Messire, it shall be as you
wish!' and as gracious a nod and bow to these two obstinate
men as he could bring himself to perform; for, of a truth,
he would gladly have given each a broken head.
</p>

<p>
Thus the actual discussion of the affair was ended.  After
that, there were only a few minor details to talk over.
</p>

<p>
'You two gentlemen,' Gilles said after a slight pause,
during which he had been wondering whether it were a
princely thing to do to rise and take his leave.  'You two
gentlemen are alone in the secret of this enterprise?'
</p>

<p>
'For the moment, yes,' replied d'Inchy guardedly.
'But others will have to know ... some might even guess.
I shall have to explain the matter to my private secretary,
and one or two members of my Privy Council have certain
rights which we could not disregard.'
</p>

<p>
'And what about Messire de Montigny?' queried Gilles
warily.
</p>

<p>
'He hath gone to Utrecht to join the Prince of Orange.'
</p>

<p>
'When doth he return?'
</p>

<p>
'Not before the summer.'
</p>

<p>
A short, quick sigh of relief escaped Gilles' lips.  At the
back of his mind there had always lurked the ever-present
fear of one who wilfully deceives his fellow-men&mdash;the fear
of being found out.  In this, Montigny was the greatest,
nay! the only danger.  With him out of the way, the
chances of discovery became remote.
</p>

<p>
'To every one else, then, Messire,' he continued more
firmly, 'I shall pass as the Prince de Froidmont.'
</p>

<p>
'To every one else, Monseigneur,' replied d'Inchy.
</p>

<p>
'To Madame Jacqueline de Broyart?'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'She hath no suspicions?'
</p>

<p>
'None.'
</p>

<p>
'Doth she know that it is your desire she should become
the wife of the Duc d'Anjou ... that she should become
my wife, I mean?'
</p>

<p>
'No, Monseigneur; she does not.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I have a clear field before me!' he exclaimed
gaily.
</p>

<p>
'A clear field, Monseigneur,' broke in de Lalain firmly,
'for two weeks.'
</p>

<p>
'Two weeks?' retorted Gilles with a quick frown.  'Why
only two weeks?'
</p>

<p>
'Because,' said the other with solemn earnestness,
'because the Duke of Parma's armies are already swarming
over our province.  If they should invest Cambray we
could not hold out alone.  Monseigneur must be ready by
then to support us with influence, with men and with
money.  If you turned your back on us and on the proposed
alliance with a Flemish heiress, we should have to
look once more to Orange as our future Lord.'
</p>

<p>
'I understand,' rejoined Gilles dryly.  ''Tis an
"either&mdash;or" that you place before me.'
</p>

<p>
Then, as d'Inchy remained respectfully silent, M. de
Lalain broke in abruptly:
</p>

<p>
'Think you, Monseigneur, that the people of the Netherlands,
after all that they have suffered in intolerance and
religious persecution, would accept a Catholic sovereign
unless his wife, at least, were of <i>their</i> nation and of their
faith?'
</p>

<p>
A sharp retort hovered on Gilles' lips; already a curt
'Pardi, Messire&mdash;&mdash;' had escaped him, when suddenly he
paused, listening.  A loud ripple of laughter, merry, sunny,
girlish, rang out clearly from beyond the monumental doors,
rising in its joyous cadence above the oppressive silence and
solemnity of this gloomy Palace and the grave colloquy of
Monsieur d'Inchy and his colleagues.  Only for a moment,
and the laughter died away again, making the silence and
solemnity seem more gloomy than before.  It seemed to
Gilles as if it all were part of that same dream, that it was
really intangible and non-existent, just like these sober
seigneurs, like himself, like the whole situation which had
landed him&mdash;Gilles de Crohin&mdash;into the midst of this mad
adventure.
</p>

<p>
He threw back his head and laughed in hearty echo.
The whole humour of the situation suddenly struck him
with the full force of its irresistible appeal.  Life had been
so dull, so drab, so uneventful of late!  Here was romance
and excitement and gaiety; a beautiful maid&mdash;Gilles had
become suddenly convinced that she was beautiful&mdash;some
blows; some knocks; a master to serve; a beautiful,
sorrowing Queen to console; spurs to be won and a fortune
to be made!
</p>

<p>
'And, by Heaven, Messire!' he exclaimed lightly,
'The God of Love shall favour me.  Your ward is exquisite
and I am very susceptible.  What are two weeks?  'Tis
but two seconds a man requires for losing his heart to a
beautiful wench.  And if the fickle god fails me,' he added
with a careless shrug of the shoulders, 'well, where's the
harm?  After this&mdash;this romantic episode, shall we
say?&mdash;Madame Jacqueline will either be Duchesse d'Anjou et
d'Alençon, a happy and worshipped bride, or the Prince
de Froidmont will disappear from her ken as unobtrusively
as he came.  And you, Messeigneurs,' he concluded lightly,
'will have to offer the sovereignty of the Netherlands to
one who is worthier than I.'
</p>

<p>
Neither d'Inchy nor de Lalain appeared to have anything
to say after that.  They were both looking moody&mdash;even
forbidding&mdash;for the moment, though they bowed their
heads in humble respect before this prince whose
light-heartedness jarred upon their gravity.
</p>

<p>
And here the matter ended for the nonce.  Gilles took
leave of his stiff-necked hosts and returned to 'Les Trois
Rois,' having declared most solemnly that he must have
time to prepare himself for so strange a wooing.  A masked
wench; think on it!  It changed the whole aspect of the
situation!  A respite of four days was, however, all that
was respectfully but firmly granted to him for this preparation,
and Messire Gilles spent the next few hours in trying
to devise some means whereby he could outwit the Flemish
lords and catch sight of Madame Jacqueline ere he formally
set out to woo her.  Of a truth, the dull-witted and stodgy
Flemings whom <i>Monsieur</i> affected to despise, had not much
to learn in the matter of finesse and diplomacy from the
wily Valois!  This counter-stroke on their part was a real
slap-in-the-face to the arrogant prince who was condescending
to an alliance, of which every other reigning house
in Europe would have been proud.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
WHY MADAME JACQUELINE WAS SO LATE IN GETTING TO BED
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Old Nicolle, restless and cross, was fidgeting about
the room, fingering with fussy inconsequence the
beautiful clothes which her mistress had taken off half
an hour ago preparatory to going to bed&mdash;clothes of great
value and of vast beauty, which had cost more money to
acquire than good Nicolle had ever handled in all her life.
There was the beautiful gown which Madame had worn
this evening at supper, fashioned of black satin and all
slashed with white and embroidered with pearls.  There
was the underdress of rich crimson silk, worked with gold
and silver braid; there were the stockings of crimson silk,
the high-pattened shoes of velvet, the delicately wrought
fan, the gloves of fine chamois skin, the wide collarette
edged with priceless lace.  There was also the hideous
monstrosity called the farthingale&mdash;huge hoops constructed
of whalebone and of iron which, with the no less abominable
corset of wood and steel, was intended to beautify and to
refine the outline of the female figure and only succeeded
in making it look ludicrous and ungainly.  There were,
in fact, the numberless and costly accessories which go to
the completion of a wealthy lady's toilet.
</p>

<p>
Madame had divested herself of them all and had allowed
Nicolle to wrap a woollen petticoat round her slender hips
and to throw a shawl over her shoulders.  Then, with her
fair hair hanging in heavy masses down her back, she had
curled herself up in the high-backed chair beside the open
window&mdash;the open window, an it please you! and the
evening, though mild, still one of early March!  Old Nicolle
had mumbled and grumbled.  It was ten o' the clock and
long past bedtime.  For awhile she had idled away the hour
by fingering the exquisite satin of the gown which lay in
all its rich glory upon the carved dowry chest.  Nicolle
loved all these things.  She loved to see her young
mistress decked out in all the finery which could possibly be
heaped up on a girlish and slender body.  She never thought
the silks and satins heavy when Jacqueline wore them;
she never thought the farthingale unsightly when
Jacqueline's dainty bust and shoulders emerged above it like
the handle of a huge bell.
</p>

<p>
But gradually her patience wore out.  She was sleepy,
was poor old Nicolle!  And Madame still sat squatting in
the tall chair by the open window, doing nothing apparently
save to gaze over the courtyard wall to the distance beyond,
where the graceful steeple of St. Géry stood outlined like
delicate lace-work against the evening sky.
</p>

<p>
''Tis time Madame got to bed,' reiterated the old woman
for the twentieth time.  'The cathedral tower hath chimed
the quarter now.  Whoever heard of young people not
being abed at this hour!  And Madame sitting there,'
she added, muttering to herself, 'not clothed enough to
look decent!'
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline de Broyart looked round to old Nicolle with
amusement dancing in her merry blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Not decent?' she exclaimed with a laugh.  'Why, my
dear Colle, nobody sees me but you!'
</p>

<p>
'People passing across the courtyard might catch sight
of Madame,' said Nicolle crossly.
</p>

<p>
'People?' retorted Jacqueline gaily.  'What people?'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur had company to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'They all went away an hour ago.'
</p>

<p>
'Then there are the varlets and maids&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'E'en so,' rejoined Jacqueline lightly, 'my attire,
meseems, is not lacking in modesty.  I am muffled up to my
nose in a shawl and&mdash;&mdash;  Oh!' she added with a quick sigh
of impatience, 'I am so comfortable in this soft woollen
petticoat.  I feel like a human being in it and not like a
cathedral bell.  How I wish my guardian would not insist
on my wearing all these modish clothes from Paris!  I
was so much more comfortable when I could don what I
most fancied.'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur le Baron d'Inchy,' said Nicolle
sententiously, 'knows what is due to your rank, Madame, and
to your wealth.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! a murrain upon my rank and upon my wealth!'
cried the young girl hotly.  'My dear mother rendered me
a great disservice when she bare me to this world.  She
should have deputed some simple, comfortable soul for the
work, who could have let me roam freely about the town
when I liked, run about the streets barefooted, with a short
woollen kirtle tied round my waist and my hair flying loose
about my shoulders.  I could have been so happy as a
humble burgher's daughter or a peasant wench.  I do so
loathe all the stiffness and the ceremony and the starched
ruffles and high-heeled shoes.  What I want is to be
free&mdash;free!&mdash;Oh!&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
And Jacqueline de Broyart stretched out her arms and
sighed again, half-longingly, half-impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'You want to be free, Madame,' muttered old Nicolle
through her toothless gums, 'so that you might go and meet
that masked gallant who has been haunting the street
with his music of late.  You never used to sigh like this
after freedom and ugly gowns before he appeared upon the
scene.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't scold, old Colle!' pleaded the girl softly.  And now
her arms were stretched towards the old waiting-woman.
</p>

<p>
Nicolle resisted the blandishment.  She was really cross
just now.  She turned her back resolutely upon the
lovely pleader, avoiding to look into those luminous blue
eyes, which had so oft been compared by amorous swains
to the wild hyacinths that grow in the woods above
Marcoing.
</p>

<p>
'Come and kiss me, Colle,' whispered the young charmer,
'I feel so lonely somehow to-night.  I feel as if&mdash;as if&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
And the young voice broke in a quaint little gasp which was
almost like a sob.
</p>

<p>
In a moment Nicolle&mdash;both forgiving and repentant&mdash;was
kneeling beside the high-backed chair, and with loving,
wrinkled hands holding a delicate lace handkerchief, she
wiped the tears which had gathered on Jacqueline's long,
dark lashes.
</p>

<p>
'My precious lamb, my dove, my little cabbage!' she
murmured lovingly.  'What ails thee?  Why dost thou
cry?  Surely, my pigeon, thou hast no cause to be tearful.
All the world is at thy feet; every one loves thee, and
M. de Landas&mdash;surely the finest gentleman that ever walked
the earth!&mdash;simply worships the ground thy little foot
treads on.  And&mdash;and'&mdash;added the old woman pitiably&mdash;'thy
old Colle would allow herself to be cut into a thousand
pieces if it would please thee.'
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Jacqueline broke into a sudden, gay and
rippling laugh, even though the tears still glistened on her
lashes.
</p>

<p>
'I shouldn't at all enjoy,' she said lightly, 'seeing my
dear old Colle cut into a thousand pieces.'
</p>

<p>
'Then what is it, my beloved?'
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline made no reply.  For a few seconds she remained
quite silent, her eyes fixed into nothingness above
old Colle's head.  One would almost have thought that
she was listening to something which the old woman could
not hear, for the expression on her face was curiously tense,
with eyes glowing and lips parted, while the poise of her
girlish figure was almost rigidly still.  The flame of the
wax candles in the tall sconces flickered gently in the
draught, for the casement-window was wide open and a
soft breeze blew in from the west.
</p>

<p>
'Come, my cabbage,' pleaded Nicolle as she struggled
painfully to her feet.  'Come and let thy old Colle put thee to
bed.  Thou must be tired after that long supper party and
listening to so much talking and music.  And to-morrow
yet another banquet awaits thee.  Monseigneur hath
already desired thy presence&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I don't want to go to another banquet to-morrow,
Colle,' sighed the young girl dolefully.  'And I am sick
of company and of scrapings and bowings and kissing of
hands&mdash;stupid flummery wherewith men regale me because
I am rich and because they think that I am a brainless
nincompoop.  I would far rather have supper quietly in
my room every night&mdash;quite alone&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
But old Colle evidently thought that she knew better
than that.  'Heu! heu!' she muttered with a shrug of
the shoulders, accompanied by a knowing wink.  'What
chance wouldst thou have then of seeing M. de Landas?'
</p>

<p>
'I hardly can speak with M. de Landas during those
interminable banquets,' rejoined Jacqueline with a sigh.
'My guardian or else M. de Lalain always seem in the way
now whenever he tries to come nigh me.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll warrant though that M. de Landas knows how to
circumvent Monseigneur,' riposted the old woman slyly.
Like so many of her sex who have had little or no romance
in a dull and monotonous life, there was nothing that old
Colle enjoyed more than to help forward a love intrigue
or a love adventure.  M. de Landas she had, as it were,
taken under her special protection.  He was very handsome
and liberal with money, and in his love-making he had all
the ardour of his Southern blood, all of which attributes
vastly appealed to old Colle.  The fact that Monseigneur
le Baron d'Inchy did not altogether favour the young man's
suit&mdash;especially of late&mdash;lent additional zest to Nicolle's
championship of his claims.
</p>

<p>
'Even so,' said Jacqueline with sudden irrelevance,
'there are moments when one likes to be alone.  There
is so much to think about&mdash;to dream of&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I know, I know,' murmured the old woman crossly.
'Thy desire is to sit here half the evening now by the open
window, and catch a deathly ague while listening to that
impudent minstrel who dares to serenade so great a lady.'
</p>

<p>
She went on muttering and grumbling and fidgeting
about the room, unmindful of the fact that at her words
Jacqueline had suddenly jumped to her feet; eyes blazing,
small fists clenched, cheeks crimson, she suddenly faced
the garrulous old woman.
</p>

<p>
'Nicolle, be silent!' she commanded.  'At once!  Dost
hear?'
</p>

<p>
'Silent?  Silent?' grumbled the woman.  'I have been
silent quite long enough, and if Monseigneur were to hear of
these doings 'tis old Nicolle who would get the blame.  As
for M. de Landas, I do verily believe that he would run his
sword right through the body of the rogue for his impudence!
I know....  I know,' she added, with a tone of spite in
her gruff voice.  'But let me tell thee that if that rascally
singer dares to raise his voice again to-night&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
She paused, a little frightened at the fierce wrath which
literally blazed out of her mistress's eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Well?' said Jacqueline peremptorily, but in a very
husky voice.  'Why dost thou not finish?  What will
happen if the minstrel, whose singing hath given me
exquisite joy these three nights past, were to raise his
heavenly voice again?'
</p>

<p>
'Pierre will make it unpleasant for him, that's all!'
replied the old woman curtly.
</p>

<p>
'Pierre?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; Pierre!  M. de Landas' serving-man.  I told him
to be on the look-out, outside the postern gate,
and&mdash;well!&mdash;Pierre has a strong fist and a heavy staff, and...'
</p>

<p>
In a moment Jacqueline was by Nicolle's side.  She
seized the old woman by the wrist so that poor Colle cried
out with pain, and it was as the very living image of a
goddess of wrath that the young girl now confronted her
terrified serving-maid.
</p>

<p>
'Thou hast dared to do that, Nicolle?' she demanded
in a choked and quivering voice.  'Thou wicked, interfering
old hag!  I hate thee!' she went on remorselessly, not
heeding the looks of terror and of abject repentance
wherewith Colle received this floodgate of vituperation.  'I
hate thee, dost hear?  And if Pierre doth but dare to lay
hands on that exquisite singer I'll ask M. de Landas to have
him flogged&mdash;yes, flogged!  And I'll never wish to see thy
face again&mdash;thou wicked, wicked Colle!'
</p>

<p>
Mastered by her own emotion and her passionate resentment,
Jacqueline sank back into a chair, her voice broken
with sobs, and tears of genuine rage streaming down her
cheeks.  Nicolle, quite bewildered, had stood perfectly
still, paralysed in fact, whilst this storm of wrathful
indignation burst over her devoted head.  In spite of her terror
and of her remorse, there had lingered round her wrinkled
lips a line or two of mulish obstinacy.  The matter of
the unknown singer, who had not only ventured to serenade
the great and noble Dame Jacqueline, Duchesse et Princesse
de Ramèse and of several other places, just as if she
were some common burgher's wench with a none too
spotless reputation, had not ended with a song or two:
no! the malapert had actually been impudent enough last
night to scale the courtyard wall and to stand for over half
an hour just below Madame's window (how he knew which
was Madame's window Satan, his accomplice, alone could
tell!) singing away to the accompaniment of a twangy lute,
which she&mdash;Nicolle&mdash;for one, could never abide.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, on that occasion Madame Jacqueline had
been both modest and discreet.  She had kept well within
the room and even retired into the alcove, well out of sight
of that abominable rascal; but she would not allow Colle
to close the window and had been very angry indeed when
the old woman with a few gruff and peremptory words had
presently sent the malapert away.
</p>

<p>
That was yesterday.  And now this outburst of rage!
It was unbelievable!  Madame Jacqueline of a truth was
hot-tempered and passionate&mdash;how could she help being
otherwise, seeing that she had been indulged and adulated
ever since, poor mite of three, she had lost both father and
mother and had been under the guardianship of Monseigneur
d'Inchy and of half a dozen other gentlemen.
Never, however, had Colle seen her quite like this, and for
such a worthless cause!  Colle could scarce credit her eyes
and ears.  And alas! there was no mistaking the flood
of heartrending weeping which followed.  Jacqueline sat
huddled up in her chair, her face buried in her hands,
sobbing and weeping as if her heart would break.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
All the obstinacy in the worthy old soul melted away in
an instant, giving place to heartrending remorse.  She
fell on her knees, she took the small feet of her adored
mistress in her hands and kissed them and wept over them
and cried and lamented tearfully.
</p>

<p>
'Lord God, what have I done?' she called out from the
depths of her misery.  'My dove, my cabbage!  Look
at me&mdash;look at thy old Colle!  Dost not know that I would
far sooner bite my tongue out than say one word that
would offend thee?  My lamb, wilt not look at Colle?&mdash;I
vow&mdash;I swear that I'll die here on the spot at thy feet,
if thou'lt not smile on me!'
</p>

<p>
Gradually as the old woman wept and pleaded, Jacqueline
became more calm.  The sobs no longer shook her
shoulders, but she still kept her face hidden in her hands.
A few minutes went by.  Colle had buried her old head in
the young girl's lap, and after a while Jacqueline, regally
condescending to forgive, allowed her hand to fall on the
bowed head of the repentant sinner.
</p>

<p>
'I'll only forgive thee, Colle,' she said with solemn
earnestness, 'if Pierre doth not lay a finger upon that heavenly
singer&mdash;but, if he does&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Colle struggled to her feet as quickly as her stiff joints
would allow.
</p>

<p>
'I'll go and find the varlet myself,' she said fiercely,
ready to betray with cowardly baseness the confederate of
awhile ago, now that she had propitiated the mistress whom
she adored.  'M. de Landas hath not yet left the Palace,
and if Pierre dares but raise his hand against that
mal&mdash;hem!&mdash;against the noble singer whom thou dost honour
with thine attention, well! he'll have to reckon with old
Colle; that is all!'
</p>

<p>
With Jacqueline de Broyart&mdash;who in herself appeared the
very embodiment of spring, so full of youth, of grace and of
vitality was she&mdash;sunshine and storm came in rapid succession
over her moods, just as they do over the skies when the
year is young.  Already her eyes, bathed in tears of rage
awhile ago, were glistening with pleasure, and her lips, which
had pouted and stormed, were parted in a smile.
</p>

<p>
'Go, Colle!' she said eagerly.  'Go at once, ere it be too
late and that fool Pierre&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
The words died upon her lips.  The next instant she had
jumped down from her chair and run to the window.  From
some distance down the street there had come, suddenly
wafted upon the wings of the wind, the sound of a voice
singing the well-known verses of Messire de Ronsard:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Mignonne, allons voir si la rose<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qui ce matin avait desclose<br />
  Sa robe de pourpre au soleil<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point perdu cette vesprée<br />
  Les plis de sa robe pourprée<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et son teint au vostre pareil.'[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>]<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap07fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap07fn1text">1</a>] 'Mignonne, come see if the rose<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this morning did unclose<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her purple robe to the sun<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath not ere this evening lost<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those purple petals most<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tint with your tint one.'<br />
<br />
(Translation by Mr. Percy Allen.  <i>Songs of Old France</i>.)
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jacqueline knelt upon the window-seat, but she could
see nothing, so she turned back piteously to murmur to
old Colle: 'Oh!  if I could only see him!'
</p>

<p>
The old woman, after the experience of the past few
minutes, was ready to do anything, however abject, to
further her mistress' desire.
</p>

<p>
'Put on thy mask, my pigeon,' she said, 'and then lean
well out of the window; but not too far, for fear M. de Landas
should happen to be passing in the courtyard and should see
thee with thy hair down.  No, no!' added the old hypocrite
obsequiously, 'there is no harm in listening to so sweet a
singer.  I'll get thy purse, too, and thou canst throw him a
coin or two.  No doubt the poor fellow is down-at-heels and
only sings to earn his supper.'
</p>

<p>
And humble, fussy, still snivelling, Nicolle shuffled across
the room, found the satin mask and brought it to her mistress.
Jacqueline fixed it over her face; then she leaned as far
out of the window as she dared to do without fear of falling
out.  And, if M. de Landas saw her, why! he would be
so gladdened at the sight that he would have no ear for a
mere street musician, whilst she&mdash;Jacqueline&mdash;was just now
in so soft a mood that if M. de Landas happened to scale
the wall to her casement-window&mdash;as he had more than once
threatened to do&mdash;she would return his kisses in a way that
she had never done before.
</p>

<p>
For she was deeply in love with M. de Landas, had been
for years.  She had plighted her troth to him when she was
a mere child, and she loved him&mdash;oh yes! she loved him
very, very much, only...
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
There was the width of the courtyard and the tall wall
between Jacqueline and the street where stood the singer
whom she so longed to see.  She had caught sight of him
yesterday when, to Nicolle's horror, he had boldly scaled
the wall and then had lingered for nigh on half an hour
beneath her window, singing one merry song after another,
till her young heart had been filled with a new joy, the cause
of which she herself could not quite comprehend.
</p>

<p>
She had watched him unseen, fearful lest some of the
serving-men should see him and drive him away.  Fortunately
Chance had been all in favour of her new romance.
M. de Landas was on duty at the Forts that night; her
guardian was still closeted with some other grave seigneurs,
and the serving-men were no doubt too busy to trouble
about a harmless minstrel.  As for the wenches about the
place, they had stood about in the doorways, listening with
delight at the impassioned songs and gaping in admiration
at the splendid bearing of the unknown cavalier.
</p>

<p>
Thus the singer had stood in the courtyard for some
considerable time, his martial figure silhouetted against the
clear, moonlit sky, his voice rising and falling in perfect
cadence to the accompaniment of a soft-toned lute, whilst
Jacqueline, hidden within the shadow of the window-embrasure,
listened spellbound, her whole youth, her ardent,
loving soul exultant at this romance which was taking birth
at her feet.
</p>

<p>
And now he had come back, and the very night seemed to
bid him welcome.  It was still quite early in March, yet
the air was soft as spring.  All day the birds had been
twittering under the eaves, and on the west wind had come
wafted gently the scent of budding almond blossom and of
the life-giving sap in the branches of the trees.
</p>

<p>
The stately city with its towers and steeples and cupolas
lay bathed in the light of the honey-coloured moon.  Far
away on the right, the elegant church of Saint Géry up on
the Mont-des-Boeufs seemed like a bar of silver which
attached old Cambray to the star-studded firmament above,
and around it were grouped the tall steeples of St. Martin,
St. Waast and St. Aubert, with the fine hexagon of Martin
et Martine which crowned the Town Hall; whilst, dominating
this forest of perfect and rich architecture, was the mass
of the cathedral close by, with its tall pointed steeple, its
flying buttresses, its numberless delicate pinnacles picked
out as by a fairy hand against the background of deep
azure.
</p>

<p>
But Jacqueline de Broyart had for the nonce no eyes for
all that beauty.  What cared she if the wintry moon outlined
all these lovely heights with delicate lines of silver?  What
cared she if the shadows of stately edifices appeared full of
a golden glow by contrast with the cold blue of the lights?
Her eyes were fixed, not on the tower of St. Géry nor on
the steeple of Notre Dame: they rested upon that high
and cruel wall which hid the unknown singer from her
sight.
</p>

<p>
'Mignonne!' he sang out gaily.  'Allons voir la rose&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' sighed Jacqueline with passionate longing.  'If
I only could&mdash;&mdash;!'
</p>

<p>
And her fancy went soaring into a world of romance&mdash;a
world far away from the sordid strifes, the political intrigues,
the quarrels of to-day; a world wherein men were all
handsome and brave and women were all free to grant them
their hand to kiss, to listen to their songs, to reward their
prowess, to receive their homage unfettered by convention&mdash;a
world, in fact, such as Messire de Froissart had chronicled
and of which Messire Villon had sung so exquisitely.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly Jacqueline's dreams were rudely interrupted,
as was also the song of the unseen minstrel.  Loud
voices were raised and there was a clash which made
Jacqueline's very heart turn cold in her bosom.
</p>

<p>
'Colle!' she cried excitedly.
</p>

<p>
But Colle had shuffled out of the room some little while
ago, in search of Pierre, no doubt, whom evidently she had
failed to find.  And out there behind that cruel wall the
rough hands of that abominable varlet were being laid on
the precious person of the unsuspecting minstrel.  Jacqueline
felt literally paralysed both with terror and with wrath.
Colle had spoken of Pierre's stout arm and still stouter
stick, but there was also the possibility of M. de Landas
himself being about, and then&mdash;oh, then! ... Ye heavens
above! anything might happen! ... Oh! the wicked,
wicked old woman and that execrable Pierre! ... and
... and of course M. de Landas' jealousy was sometimes
terrifying!
</p>

<p>
'God in Heaven!' sighed Jacqueline.  'I entreat Thee
to protect him!'
</p>

<p>
The noise of the scuffle in the street became louder and
louder.  There were cries of rage as well as of pain.  Blows
were evidently raining freely&mdash;on whom?  My God, on
whom?  Then, from further up the street, came the sound
of running footsteps as well as the stern voice of the night
watchmen hurrying to the scene.  Jacqueline would have
bartered some years of her life to see what was going on
the other side of the wall.  Only a minute or two had gone
by: to the young girl it had seemed like hours of suspense.
And now these people all rushing along, no doubt in order
to give a hand to Pierre&mdash;to fall on the unarmed minstrel&mdash;to
lay hands upon him&mdash;to belabour him with sticks&mdash;to
wound or hurt him&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline uttered a loud cry of horror.  It was the
echo of one of terror, of pain and of rage which came from
the other side of the wall.  The next moment a dark mass
appeared over the top of the wall, silhouetted against the
moonlit sky.  To Jacqueline's straining eyes it seemed like
the body of a man which, for the space of a brief second,
seemed to hover in mid air and then fell with a dull thud
upon the paving-stones of the courtyard below.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline closed her eyes.  She felt sick and faint.
To her ears now came the sound of loud groans and vigorous
curses.  And then&mdash;oh, then!&mdash;loud laughter and the last
bar of the interrupted song&mdash;a sound indeed which caused
her at once to open her eyes again; whereupon she, too,
could have laughed and sung for joy.  The inert mass still
lay in a heap at the foot of the wall; Jacqueline could
vaguely discern its outline in the gloom, whilst up on the
top of the wall, astride, hatless, lute in hand, sat the masked
minstrel with his head turned gazing toward her window.
</p>

<p>
She clapped her hands with glee, and he, with a loud cry
of 'Mignonne!' swung himself down from the wall and
ran across the courtyard until he came to a halt just beneath
her window, and even in the dim light of this wintry moon
Jacqueline thought that she could see his eyes glowing
through the holes in the mask.
</p>

<p>
It was all so joyous, so gay, so romantic; so different&mdash;ah! so
very, very different&mdash;to the dreary monotony of
Jacqueline's daily existence!  This masked and unknown
minstrel!  His daring, his prowess, aye! his very impudence,
which laughed at high walls and defied an army of varlets!
There was Pierre moaning and groaning, disarmed and helpless,
having been tossed over the wall just as if he were a
bale of cumbersome goods!  Serve him right well, too, for
having dared to measure his valour against that of so proud
a cavalier!  Pierre was not hurt&mdash;oh, Jacqueline was quite
sure that he was not hurt!  Nothing, nothing whatever,
was going to be wrong on this lovely, glorious evening!
No!  Pierre would soon be healed of his wounds; but it
was ludicrous to see him stretched out just there, where he
thought he could lay the noble singer low!
</p>

<p>
'Mignonne, allons voir si la rose,' sang the mysterious
minstrel; and Jacqueline's young heart, which was filled
with the joy of romance, the exquisite rapture of ideals,
suddenly ached with a passionate longing for&mdash;for what?
She did not know.  She had had so many things in life:
riches, beauty, adulation, aye! and the love of a man whom
she loved in return.  But now it seemed to her as if, in spite
of all that, in spite of M. de Landas and his love, she had
really lacked something all the time&mdash;something that was
both undefinable and mystic and yet was intensely and
vividly real, something that would fill her life, that would
satisfy her soul and gladden her heart, in a way that
M. de Landas' love, his passionate kisses, had never succeeded
in doing hitherto.
</p>

<p>
And somehow all this longing, all this thirst for a
still-unknown happiness, seemed personified in the singer with
the tall, broad stature and the mellow voice; it was embodied
in the honey-coloured moon, in the glints of silver and gold
upon the steeples of Cambray, in the scent of the spring
and the murmurs of the breeze.  Jacqueline pressed her
hands against her heart.  She was so happy that she could
have cried.
</p>

<p>
Beside her on the window-sill stood a tall vase fashioned
of Dutch clay.  It was filled with tall-stemmed Madonna
lilies, which had been produced at great cost in the
hot-houses belonging to her own estate in Hainault.  Their
powerful scent had filled the room with its fragrance.
Without thought or hesitation, Jacqueline suddenly pulled
the sheaf out of the vase and gathered the flowers in her
arms.  The tender, juicy stems were wet and she took her
embroidered handkerchief out of her pocket and wrapped
it round them; then she flung the whole sheaf of lilies out
of the window and watched to see them fall, bruised and
sweet-smelling, at the minstrel's feet.
</p>

<p>
Then, half-ashamed, laughing a little hysterically, but
thoroughly happy and excited, she drew quickly back into
the room and hastily closed the casement.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
When, ten minutes or so later, Nicolle came back, shame-faced,
remorseful and not a little frightened, she was surprised
and delighted to find her young mistress sitting quite
composedly in a high-backed chair in the centre of the room, the
window closed, and the lady herself quite eager to go to
bed.
</p>

<p>
'Thou hast been gone a long time, Colle,' said the young
girl carelessly.  'Where hast thou been?'
</p>

<p>
Old Colle sighed with relief.  The Lord be praised!
Madame had evidently seen and heard nothing of that vulgar
scuffle which had ended in such disaster for poor Pierre, and
in such a triumph for the impudent rascal who had since
disappeared just as quickly as he came.
</p>

<p>
'I just went round to see that those wenches were all
abed and that their lights were safely out,' replied the old
woman with brazen hypocrisy.
</p>

<p>
'And didst speak to Pierre on the way?' queried Jacqueline,
who had assumed the quaintest possible air of simple
ingenuousness.
</p>

<p>
'Aye!' replied the old woman dryly.  'I spoke to
Pierre.'
</p>

<p>
'What did he say?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing of importance.  We talked of to-morrow's
banquet.'
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow's banquet?'
</p>

<p>
'Do not feign surprise, my pigeon,' rejoined old Colle,
who was decidedly out of humour.  'I even asked thee
to-night, before taking off thy gown, if thou wouldst wear
that one or another on the morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'I remember,' replied Jacqueline with a yawn, 'I said that
I did not care what I wore, as I hated banquets, and company
and bowings and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But Monseigneur said that the banquet to-morrow would
be for a special occasion.'
</p>

<p>
'When did he say that?'
</p>

<p>
'A moment or two ago&mdash;to Pierre.'
</p>

<p>
'And what will the special occasion be to-morrow?'
</p>

<p>
Nicolle looked mysterious.
</p>

<p>
'Maybe,' she said, 'that it is not altogether unconnected
with Monseigneur de Landas.'
</p>

<p>
'Why with him?' asked Jacqueline eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  I am only putting two and two together, my
cabbage,' replied old Colle with a sly wink.  'There is talk of
distinguished guests in Cambray, of betrothals, and
... and ...
</p>

<p>
'Betrothals?'
</p>

<p>
'Why, yes.  Thou art nearly twenty, my pigeon, and
Monseigneur, thy guardian, will have to make up his mind
that thou wilt marry sooner or later.  I always thought that
he did favour Monseigneur de Landas, until&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Until what?' queried Jacqueline impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'There are so many rumours in the air,' replied Colle
sententiously.  'Some talk of the Duc d'Anjou, who is own
brother to the King of France.'
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline made a little moue of disdain.
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  <i>Monsieur</i>!' she said carelessly.
</p>

<p>
'A very great and noble prince, my pigeon.'
</p>

<p>
'I am tired of great and noble princes.'
</p>

<p>
'But Monseigneur, the Duc d'Anjou...'
</p>

<p>
'Is one of the many, I suppose, who want my fortune, my
family connexions, the Sovereignty of the Netherlands.
Bah!' she added with an impatient sigh.  'They sicken me!'
</p>

<p>
'A great lady, my cabbage,' said Nicolle solemnly, 'cannot
follow the dictates of her heart like a common wench.'
</p>

<p>
'Why!' exclaimed Jacqueline.  'Methought thou wast
all for M. de Landas!'
</p>

<p>
'So I am, my pigeon, so I am!' rejoined the old woman.
'He is a very distinguished gentleman, who loves thee
ardently.  But if there's one who is own brother to the King
of France....'  And old Colle gave an unctuous sigh when
she spoke the exalted name.
</p>

<p>
'Bah!' retorted Jacqueline with a careless shrug of the
shoulders.  'There are others too!  And no one can force
me into a marriage whilst my heart is pledged to M. de
Landas.'
</p>

<p>
'No, no!  Thank God for that!' assented Colle piously.
'As for the others ... well! their name is legion ... some
of them will be at the banquet to-morrow....  There is
the Marquis de Hancourt, a fine-looking youth, and that
horrid German prince whom I cannot abide!  The English
lord hath gone away, so they say, broken-hearted at thy
refusal; but there's the Spanish duke, whose name I cannot
remember, and Don José, own son to the Emperor....
As for that stranger&mdash;&mdash;' she added with a contemptuous
shrug of the shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'The stranger?' queried Jacqueline lazily.  'What
stranger?
</p>

<p>
'Well, I don't know much about him.  But Pierre, feeling
crestfallen, did admit that Monseigneur chided him severely
for having shown a want of respect to a gentleman who
ought to have known better than to pretend to be a street
musician.'
</p>

<p>
But Jacqueline appeared all of a sudden to have lost
interest in the conversation.  'Ah!' she said with
well-assumed indifference, 'then the street musician of awhile
ago was a gentleman in disguise?'
</p>

<p>
'Aye! so Pierre said&mdash;the fool!' quoth old Colle
unblushingly.  'Monseigneur was very angry with him when he
heard of the altercation with the singer, threatened to speak
of the matter to M. de Landas and have Pierre flogged or
dismissed for his interference.  Then he hinted that the
stranger, far from being a street musician, was a foreign
seigneur of high degree, even if of scanty fortune.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' commented Jacqueline carelessly.
</p>

<p>
'And he e'en ordered Pierre to go and apologize most
humbly to the stranger, who it seems is lodging in a very
poor hostelry known as "Les Trois Rois," just close to the
Porte Notre Dame.'
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline ostentatiously smothered a yawn.
</p>

<p>
'I think I'll go to bed now, Colle,' she said.
</p>

<p>
But Colle's tongue, once loosened, could not so easily
be checked.
</p>

<p>
'Town gossip,' she went on with great volubility, 'has
been busy with that stranger for the past two days.  'Tis
said that he is styled Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont;
though what a prince should be doing in a shabby hostel
in that squalid quarter of the city I, for one, do not
know&mdash;nor why he should be going about masked and cloaked
through the city in the guise of a vagabond.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps the vagabond is no prince after all,' suggested
Jacqueline.
</p>

<p>
'That's what I say,' asserted Colle triumphantly.  'And
that's what Pierre thought until Monseigneur told him that if
he did not go at once and offer his humble apologies he surely
would get a flogging, seeing that the Prince de Froidmont
would actually be a guest at the banquet to-morrow,
and would of a certainty complain to M. de Landas.'
</p>

<p>
'A guest at the banquet!' exclaimed Jacqueline
involuntarily.'
</p>

<p>
'Aye!' assented Colle.  'Didst ever hear the like!  But
he must be a distinguished seigneur for all that, or
Monseigneur would not bid him come.'
</p>

<p>
'No, I suppose not,' said Jacqueline with perfect indifference.
'The Prince de Froidmont?' she added with a little
yawn.  'Is that his name?'
</p>

<p>
'So the town gossips say,' replied Colle, who was busy
just then in wrapping the bed-gown round her young
mistress's shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'And he comes to the banquet to-morrow?'
</p>

<p>
'So Monseigneur said to Pierre.'
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline said nothing more for the moment, appeared
to have lost all interest in the masked musician and in
Pierre's misdeeds.  She stretched out her arms lazily
while vigorous old Colle picked her up as if she were a baby
and carried her&mdash;as she was wont to do every night&mdash;to her
bed.
</p>

<p>
She laid her down upon the soft feather mattress and
spread the fine coverlets over her.  The alcove wherein
stood the monumental bedstead was in semi-darkness, for
the light from the wax candles in the sconces about the room
failed to penetrate into the recess.  But that semi-darkness
was restful, and for awhile Jacqueline lay back against the
pillows, with eyes closed, in a state of that complete
well-being which is one of the monopolies of youth.  Nicolle,
thinking that Madame would be dropping off to sleep, made
a movement to go; but Jacqueline's small white hand had
hold of the old woman's bony fingers, and old Colle, abjectly
happy at feeling the pressure, remained quite still,
waiting and watching, gazing with doglike devotion on the
lovely face&mdash;lovely in repose as it was when the light of
gaiety and roguishness danced in the blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
After a few minutes of this silent beatitude, Jacqueline
opened her eyes and said in a dreamy voice, half-asleep:
</p>

<p>
'Tell me, Colle, which is my prettiest gown?'
</p>

<p>
And Nicolle&mdash;herself more than half-way to the land of
Nod&mdash;roused herself in order to reply: 'The white one
with the pearls, my pigeon.'
</p>

<p>
She was sufficiently awake to feel quite happy at the
thought that Madame was suddenly taking an interest in her
clothes, and continued eagerly: 'It hath an underdress of
that lovely new green colour which hath become the mode
of late, and all embroidered with silver.  Nothing more
beautiful hath ever been fashioned by tailors' art, and in it
Madame looks just like an exquisite white lily, with the
delicate green stem below.'
</p>

<p>
'Well then, Colle,' rejoined Jacqueline dreamily,
'to-morrow evening I will wear my white satin gown with the
pearls and the underdress of green and silver, and Mathurine
must study a new way of doing my hair with the pointed
coif which they say is so modish now in France.  I will
wear my stockings of crimson silk and my velvet shoes,
and round my neck I'll wear the ropes of pearls which my
dear mother did bequeath to me; in my ears I'll have the
emerald earrings, and I'll wear the emerald ring upon my
finger.  I wish I had not that ugly mole upon my left
cheek-bone, for then I could have had one of those tiny
patches of black taffeta which are said to be so becoming
to the complexion....'
</p>

<p>
She paused, and added with quaint wistfulness: 'Think
you, Colle, that I shall look handsome?'
</p>

<p>
'As lovely as a picture, my dear one,' said Nicolle with
enthusiasm.  'As exquisite as a lily; fit only to be the
bride of a King.'
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline gave a quick sigh of satisfaction, after which
she allowed Colle to give her a kiss and to bid her a final
'good night.'
</p>

<p>
And even as she fell gradually into the delicious and
dreamless sleep of youth, her lips murmured softly:
'I wonder!'

CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
WHAT BECAME OF THE LILIES
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Gilles had spent four days at the hostelry of 'Les
Trois Rois,' and here he would have liked to remain
indefinitely and to continue the sentimental romance so
happily begun beneath the casement-windows of the
Archiepiscopal Palace.  With the light-heartedness peculiar to
most soldiers of fortune, he had during those four days
succeeded in putting his rôle out of his mind.  Though he
had not yet caught sight of Madame's face at her window,
he quite thought that he would do so in time, and already
he had received more than one indication that his singing
was not unwelcome.  The casement had been deliberately
thrown open when he had scaled the courtyard wall, and
had resumed his song immediately beneath the window
which he had ascertained belonged to Madame's private
apartment.  He had felt, even though he did not actually
see, that some one was listening to him from up there, for
once he had perceived a shadow upon the casement curtain,
and once a hand, small and delicate, had rested upon the
window-sill.  Gilles would have continued this
wooing&mdash;aye! perhaps have brought it to a happy conclusion, he
thought&mdash;without being forced to assume another personality
than his own: a thing which became more and more
abhorrent to Messire Gilles' temper, now that the time
for starting the masquerade in earnest was drawing nigh.
</p>

<p>
'We could make ourselves very happy here, honest Jehan,'
he had said to the faithful companion of his many adventures.
'Waited on by that silent and zealous youth, who
of a truth looks like the very ghost of silence and discretion.
With judicious economy, the money which a gracious Queen
hath placed in our hands would last us a year.  It seems
a pity to fritter it all away in a few weeks by playing a
rôle which is detestable and unworthy.'
</p>

<p>
'B-b-b-but&mdash;&mdash;' stammered old Jehan.
</p>

<p>
'You are quite right,' broke in Gilles gravely.  'Your
argument is very sound.  The money, my friend, was given
unto us in order to play a certain rôle, and that rôle we
must now play whether we like it or not, on pain of being
branded as vagabonds and thieves.'
</p>

<p>
'V-v-v-very&mdash;&mdash;' stammered poor Jehan.
</p>

<p>
'As you say,' remarked Gilles dryly, 'I have always found
you of good counsel, my friend.  Very likely&mdash;that is what
you would say, is it not?&mdash;very likely, unless we played
our parts as Madame la Reyne de Navarre did direct,
Monseigneur le Baron d'Inchy would discover the fraud
and have us both hanged for our pains.  And if the
hangman did happen to miss us, Madame Marguerite would
certainly see to it that a gibbet was ready for us somewhere
in France.  So for this once, I think, mine honest Jehan,
we must take it that honesty will be the best policy.'
</p>

<p>
'O-o-o-only th-th-th-that&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Quite so!' assented Gilles, 'only that in this case we
cannot contrive to remain honest without being dishonest,
which is a proposition that doth gravely disturb my mind.'
</p>

<p>
'Th-th-th-the o-o-o-only&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Hold your tongue, friend Jehan,' broke in Gilles
impatiently.  'Verily, you talk a great deal too much!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
And now, at the very close of the fourth day, Messire
Gilles made noisy irruption into the tiny room which he
occupied in the hostelry of 'Les Trois Rois.'  Maître
Jehan&mdash;after the stormy episode outside the postern gate wherein
he had taken part&mdash;was in the room, waiting for his master.
</p>

<p>
Gilles was in the rarest of good humour.  As soon as he
had closed the door behind him, he threw his plumed toque
and the lute upon the table and, sitting down on the narrow
paillasse which was his bed, he fell to contemplating a bunch
of white lilies which he had in his hand.  The stems of these
lilies were carefully wrapped in an embroidered handkerchief,
but they hung their bruised, if still fragrant, heads in a
very doleful manner.
</p>

<p>
Gilles laughed softly to himself.  Then he held the
flowers out at arm's length and called out gaily to Jehan:
</p>

<p>
'Congratulate me, honest Jehan!' he said.  'The first
act of our adventurous comedy is over.  The curtain has
rung down on a veritable triumph!  I have received a token!
... I have captured the first bastion in the citadel of the
fair one's heart!  Give me a week, and I hold the entire
fortress for and on behalf of <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou, our
august master!'
</p>

<p>
'Th-th-th-then you h-h-h-have&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'No, I have not seen her, my good man.  All that fine
fight outside the walls, the complete discomfiture of our
assailants, my perilous position inside the courtyard, from
whence a reinforcement of varlets might easily have put
me to flight, did not win for me even a glimpse of the lady.
But her window was wide open this time, and I could see
her shadow flitting past the casement.  Then suddenly these
lilies were flung at me.  They were crushed and bruised
against the pavement as they fell; but they are a token,
friend Jehan, and you cannot deny it!  Madame Jacqueline's
heart is already touched by the song of the unknown
troubadour, and he hath but to present himself before her
to be graciously received.'
</p>

<p>
'B-b-b-b-but&mdash;&mdash;' said Jehan with grave solemnity.
</p>

<p>
'That's just it!' broke in Gilles with a laugh.  'You
have a way, my friend, of hitting the right nail on the head.
As you say, the four days' respite which have been granted
to us have now expired, and we have not yet seen the future
Duchesse d'Anjou face to face.'
</p>

<p>
'N-n-n-not yet!  Th-th-th-that&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That is the trouble, I grant you.  There is that infernal
masquerade; and of a truth, I am more convinced than
ever that the reason why those noble mynheers are so
determined that Madame shall not show her face ere I have
irrevocably committed myself&mdash;I&mdash;that is, the Duc
d'Anjou&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;  Oh, my God!' he exclaimed.  'What a
tangle!!  Well, as I was saying....  By the way, what
was I saying just now?'
</p>

<p>
'Th-th-th-that&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Of course!  You incorrigible chatterbox!  I would have
explained my meaning before now if you had not talked
nineteen to the dozen all the time!  I mean that I have
completely changed my mind, and that I have become convinced
that Madame Jacqueline is as ugly as sin, else those
wily Dutchmen would not be so anxious to cover up her face.'
</p>

<p>
'Th-th-th-therefore&mdash;&mdash;' asserted Jehan stoutly.
</p>

<p>
'Therefore, my good man, good fortune is in our debt.
She did not favour me with a sight of the lady ere I meet
her in my official capacity.  But Madame Jacqueline hath
given me a token: she is prepared to love me, and I am
still in the dark as to whether she squints or is pitted with
pock-marks.  A terrible position for any man to be in!' he
sighed dolefully, 'even though he is out a-courting for a
friend.'
</p>

<p>
'B-b-b-but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You mean well, my friend,' quoth Gilles, who fell to
contemplating the bunch of faded lilies with a rueful
expression of face.  'You mean well, but you talk too much,
and thus I am thrown on mine own resources for counsel
in an emergency.  As for arguments!  Why, you would
argue the devil's horns from off his head!  Still,' he added,
as he finally flung the lilies away from him with a careless
gesture of indifference, 'still, in spite of what you say, I
must stick to my bargain.  Those mulish mynheers will
not grant us any further delay, and to-morrow I am pledged
to appear at the governor's banquet&mdash;yes, even I!&mdash;<i>Monsieur</i>
Duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon, own brother to the King of
France, and you as my faithful servitor.'
</p>

<p>
'N-n-n-not a m-m-minute t-t-too soon,' Maître Jehan
managed to blurt out quickly whilst Gilles had paused for
breath.
</p>

<p>
'Ah! there you are wrong, my friend,' retorted Gilles.
'For my taste, the dénouement is coming along at far too
rapid a pace.  To-morrow, already our troubles will begin&mdash;peace
will know us no more.  I for one will never rightly
know who I am; nor will I know who it is who will know
who I am not.  Oh, my Lord!' he added in mock despair,
as he rested his elbows on his knees and buried his head
in his hands.  'My head will split ere I have done!  Tell
me, Jehan, who I shall be to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'T-t-t-to-morrow,' stammered Jehan with painful earnestness,
'you&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;you will b-b-b-b-be&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Own brother to His Majesty the King of France,' said
Gilles, 'and as great blackguard as ever disgraced a Royal
house.  To Monseigneur the governor, and maybe also to
some of his friends, I shall be a Royal prince.  To others,
and notably to Madame Jacqueline de Broyart, I shall be
the Prince de Froidmont&mdash;an insignificant and penniless
seigneur who only dares approach the far-famed heiress
under cover of a mask, having fallen desperately in love with
her.  Ah, Jehan!  Jehan!' he added with mock solemnity,
'thou art of a truth a lucky devil!  Thou canst keep thine
own name, thine own rank, even thine own ludicrous
stutter: whereas I,&mdash;what shall I be?  A mime!  A buffoon!
And what's more, a fraudulent varlet, pledged to deceive an
innocent wench into the belief that her future lord is both
sentimental and amorous and can sing the love ditties writ
by Messire de Ronsard with passable tunefulness....
Ye gods, Jehan, hast ever heard <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou&mdash;the
real one, I mean&mdash;sing?'
</p>

<p>
'N-n-n-no!' objected Jehan in pious horror, for he did
not like to hear so exalted a personage derided.
</p>

<p>
'Then hast ever heard the barn-door rooster calling to
his favourite hen?'
</p>

<p>
'S-s-s-s-sometimes!'
</p>

<p>
'Well!' quoth Gilles lightly, 'so have I.  And I prefer
the barn-door rooster!  And now to bed, friend Jehan,' he
added as he jumped to his feet.  'To-morrow is the great
day!  Didst take my letter to the governor's palace?'
</p>

<p>
'I d-d-d-did.'
</p>

<p>
'And didst see Monseigneur the governor himself?'
</p>

<p>
Jehan nodded affirmatively.
</p>

<p>
'Gave him my letter?'
</p>

<p>
Another nod from Jehan.
</p>

<p>
'Did he look pleased?'
</p>

<p>
A shrug of the shoulders this time.
</p>

<p>
'Said he would be honoured to see Monseigneur le Duc
d'Alençon et d'Anjou at the banquet to-morrow?'
</p>

<p>
Once again a nod.
</p>

<p>
'Then to bed, chatterbox!' concluded Gilles gaily, 'for
to-morrow I begin my career as a low, deceitful hound, fit
only for the gibbet, which I dare swear is already prepared
for me!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Jehan helped his master to undress.  He pulled off the
heavy boots and laid aside the cloth jerkin, the kerseymere
trunks and worsted hose.  Then, when Messire Gilles lay
stretched out upon the hard paillasse, honest Jehan bade him
a quiet good night and went off carrying the guttering candle.
For one candle had to do duty for two customers, or even at
times for three, at the hostel of 'Les Trois Rois.'  These were
not days of luxurious caravanserai: eight square feet of
floor space, a tiny leaded window, a straw paillasse, perhaps
a table and a rickety chair, made up the sum total of a
furnished bedroom, if destined for a person of quality.
Men like Maître Jehan had to be content with the bare
boards and a horse-blanket outside their master's door, or
behind a wooden partition set up inside the latter's room.
</p>

<p>
Jehan went off, then, with the candle, and Gilles de
Crohin remained in almost total darkness, for the light of
the moon failed to penetrate through the narrow aperture
which went by the name of window.  For a long time Messire
Gilles lay motionless, staring into the gloom.  Vague
pictures seemed to flit before his gaze: the unknown girl
whom he was pledged to woo appeared and disappeared
before him, now walking across his line of vision with stately
dignity, now dancing a wild rigadoon like some unruly
country wench; but always, and with irritating persistence,
wearing a mask which he longed to drag away from her face.
Then he saw pictures of fair Marguerite of Navarre, imperious
yet appealing, and of his own cross-hilted sword, upon the
sacred emblem of which he had pledged himself to an ugly
deception; Monsieur Duc d'Anjou, indolent and vapid,
dressed in that ludicrous green satin suit, came and mocked
him through the darkness.
</p>

<p>
Gilles de Crohin, wearied with all these phantasmagoria,
began tossing restlessly upon his hard bed, and as he did
so he flung his arm out over the coverlet and his hand
came in rough contact with the floor.  And there, close to
his touch, was something soft and velvety, the drooping,
fading lilies which an unknown lady of high degree had
flung out to him and which he had so carelessly tossed
aside.  His hand closed tightly upon the flowers, crushing
the last spark of life out of the fragrant blossoms, and even
as he did so&mdash;quite unconsciously and mechanically&mdash;an
unpleasant pang of remorse shot right through his heart.
Was this unconscious act of his a presage of the cruel rôle
which he had set out to play?  Would the young soul of an
innocent girl droop and wither beneath his careless touch?
</p>

<p>
Very gently now Gilles, turning on his side, gathered
the flowers together and drew them towards him.  Something
of their fragrance still lingered in the bruised petals.
Gilles got out of bed.  His eyes had become accustomed to
the darkness, or perhaps something of the radiance of the
moonlit night had penetrated into the narrow room.  Gilles
could see his way about, and he remembered that in the
further corner there had stood a pitcher filled with fresh
water.  With infinite precaution he unwound the handkerchief
from around the stems and then dropped the flowers
one by one into the pitcher.  After awhile he picked up
the handkerchief.  It was nothing now but a damp and
sodden little ball, but it smelt sweetly of lilies and of lavender.
Gilles marvelled if the lady's initials and coronet were
embroidered in the-corner.  He felt with his fingers in order
to make sure; but he was too inexperienced in such matters
to arrive at any definite conclusion, so with a sudden impulse
which he would not have cared to analyse, he searched the
darkness for his doublet, and having found it he thrust the
damp little rag into its breast-pocket.
</p>

<p>
Then, with a laugh at his own folly and a light shrug
of the shoulders, he went back to bed.  This time he fell at
once into a dreamless sleep.

CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
HOW MESSIRE GILLES WAS REMINDED OF A DREAM
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
In Maître C. Calviac's treatise on the manners and tone
of good society, which he published in the year 1560[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>]
for the guidance of those who desired to frequent the
company of the Great, we are told that 'when we enter the
presence of exalted personages, we must walk on the tips of
our toes, incline our body and make a profound obeisance.'  And
further, Maître Calviac goes on to explain the many
different modes of saluting, which we might adopt for the
occasion: 'Firstly,' he says, 'we can uncover our right
hand, with it lower our hat by stretching the arm down
along our right thigh and leaving our left hand free.
Secondly, we can regard humbly and reverentially the
exalted one whom we desire to salute.  Thirdly, we can
lower our gaze and advance our right foot whilst drawing
the left one slightly back.  We can also take off the glove
from our right hand, incline our body, and after nearly
touching the ground with our hand, carry our fingers to our
lips, as if in the act of imprinting a kiss upon their tips.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap09fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap09fn1text">1</a>] La Civile Honnêteté, par C. Calviac.  Paris 1560.  in-12.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Finally, our accomplished monitor tells us that the embrace
is yet another form of salute which cannot, however, be
practised save between persons of equal rank or those who
are bound to one another by ties of kinship or of especial
friendship.  In that case, the most civil manner of thus
saluting is for each to place the right hand on the top of the
other's shoulder and the left hand just below, and then
present the left cheek one to the other, without touching
or actually kissing the same.
</p>

<p>
We may take it that Monseigneur le Baron d'Inchy,
governor of the province of Cambrésis, being an exalted
personage himself and closely connected by family ties with
Madame Jacqueline de Broyart&mdash;whose guardian and protector
he was&mdash;did adopt the latter mode of salutation when,
at eight o'clock precisely of the following evening, he
presented himself before his young ward for the purpose of
conducting her to the State dining-room, where a banquet
in honour of several distinguished guests was already spread.
We may take it, I say, that Monseigneur the governor did
take off his right-hand glove, advance his right foot and walk
on the tips of his toes; that he did place one hand on Madame
Jacqueline's shoulder, whilst she did the same to him, and
that they each presented the left cheek to one another in
accordance with the laws of propriety laid down by Maître
Calviac.
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur was accompanied by a young man whose
manners and demeanour were even more punctilious and
ceremonious than those of his companion.  The airs and
graces wherewith he advanced in order to greet Madame
Jacqueline would have done honour to a Grand Master at
the Court of the Spanish King.  And, indeed, many did aver
that M. le Marquis de Landas had Spanish blood in his veins,
and that, though he was a Netherlander by birth, and a
Protestant by practise, he was a Spaniard and a Papist by
tradition&mdash;which fact did not tend to make him popular
in the Cambrésis, where the armies of Alexander Farnesse,
Duke of Parma, were already over-running the villages,
rumour being rife that they were about to threaten Cambray.
</p>

<p>
'Twas well said of M. le Marquis de Landas that none
knew better than he how to turn a compliment.  Perhaps
that same strain of Spanish blood in him had given him
glibness of tongue and the languorous look in the eyes which
had rendered many a favoured lady proud.  He was known
to be of exalted lineage but not endowed with fortune,
connected too with some of the noblest families both in
Flanders and in Spain, and had lately come to the Cambrésis
as aide-de-camp to his kinsman, the baron d'Inchy,
who had promptly given him command of the garrison of
Cambray.
</p>

<p>
So much for facts that were known.  But there were
rumours and conjectures, not altogether false, it seems, that
M. de Landas was a suitor for Madame Jacqueline's hand&mdash;one
of the many, of course; for her hand was sought far
and wide.  She would bring a rich dowry as her marriage
portion to any man who was lucky enough to win her, and
also the influence of her Flemish kinsmen, who had already
boldly asserted that the Sovereignty of the Netherlands
would go with the hand of Madame Jacqueline de Broyart.
</p>

<p>
Many favoured the French alliance; others preferred the
Netherlander with the strain of quasi-royal Spanish blood
in him.  The Marquis de Landas would prove a useful link
between the Spaniards and the Netherlanders, would know
how to smoothe many difficulties, calm the obstinate
temperament of the Dutch and gloss over the tyranny of
their masters.  He had suave manners and a persuasive
tongue, useful in politics.  The ladies of Cambray at once
adored him: his olive skin, his dark hair which clustered
in heavy waves above the well-cut oval of his face, his large
brown, velvety eyes, were all destined to please the fair
sex.  He wore a silky moustache and the small, pointed
beard on his chin, and his cheeks were of a blue-black colour
all down where the barber shaved him every day.  Whene'er
he gazed on a young and pretty woman his eyes would
assume an amorous expression and his lips were curved and
of a bright cherry-red, like those of a girl.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Between Jacqueline and her young kinsman there had
sprung just that kind of love which is made up of passion
on the one side and innocent devotion on the other.  At
first it had flourished almost unopposed&mdash;ignored, probably,
as being of no importance.  Monseigneur d'Inchy's plans for
his ward had been both immature and vague, for, until a
year or so ago Jacqueline had a brother living&mdash;Jan, a couple
of years older than herself, who was the owner of the rich
Netherlands duchies and on the point of taking unto himself
a wife.  But, with the death of that brother, Jacqueline
at once became a personage of vast importance.  She had
remained the sole possessor of the princely heritage and
thereby a pawn in the political game in which the Sovereignty
of the Netherlands was the priceless guerdon.
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur d'Inchy's plans began to mature: ineligible
and obscure suitors were quickly given the cold shoulder
and an imaginary barrier was drawn around Madame
Jacqueline into the inner circle of which only scions of kingly
or great princely houses were allowed to enter.  Jacqueline's
dowry rendered her a fit mate even for a King.
</p>

<p>
Even M. de Landas, more highly connected than most,
backed too by his Royal Spanish kindred, found that his
position as an approved suitor had suddenly become gravely
imperilled.  Monseigneur d'Inchy no longer looked on him
as an altogether desirable mate for the richest heiress in the
Netherlands, now that one of the sons of the Emperor, a
reigning German duke, and the brother of the King of
France, were among those who had entered the lists for her
favours.
</p>

<p>
But, as is nearly always the case in such matters, the
boy and girl affection ripened, with this growing opposition,
into something more ardent and more passionate.  M. de
Landas, who hitherto had dallied with his pretty cousin
just to the extent that suited his wayward fancy, suddenly
realized that he was very deeply enamoured of her; jealousy
did the rest, transforming transient sentiment into impetuous
and exacting fervour.
</p>

<p>
As for Jacqueline, though she was no longer a mere child,
she was totally inexperienced and unversed in the knowledge
of human hearts&mdash;not excepting her own.  She loved de
Landas dearly, had loved him ever since he first began to
speak of love to her.  It is so difficult for a girl, as yet
untouched by searing passion, to distinguish between
sentimental affection and the love which fills a life.  Landas
whispered amorous, tender, flattering words in her ear, had
fine, flashing eyes which, with their glance of bold admiration,
were wont to bring the warm blood to her cheeks.  He had
a way with him, in fact, which quickly swept her off her
feet in the whirlpool of his infatuation, long before she had
learned that there were other streams whereon she could
have launched her barque of life, with a greater certainty of
happiness.
</p>

<p>
Her heart was touched by his ardour, even though her
senses were not fully awakened yet; but she yielded to his
caresses with a girlish surrender of self, not realizing that
the thrill of pleasure which she felt was as ephemeral as it
was shallow.  She admired him for his elegant manners,
which he had acquired at the Spanish Court, for they stood
out in brilliant contrast to the more uncouth Flemish ways;
whilst his admiration for her was so unbounded that, despite
herself, the young girl felt enraptured by his glowing looks.
</p>

<p>
To-night she knew that she was beautiful, and that consciousness
lent her a quaint air of dignity and self-possession.
An unwonted excitement which she could not account for
caused her eyes to shine like stars through the slits of her
mask.  De Landas could only gaze in rapt wonderment
at the vision of radiant youth and loveliness which stood
before him in the person of Jacqueline de Broyart.
</p>

<p>
'You are more adorable to-night than ever, my beloved,'
he contrived to whisper to her behind Monseigneur d'Inchy's
back.  'And I am thankful that Monseigneur's orders have
decreed that so much beauty shall remain hidden from
unworthy eyes.'
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur, it seems, just caught these last few words,
but mistook their exact meaning.  'All the ladies, my dear
de Landas,' he said somewhat tartly, 'who belong to our
circle will appear masked at all future public functions until
I myself do rescind this order.'
</p>

<p>
'I was not complaining, Messire,' retorted de Landas
dryly.  'On the contrary, I, as a devoted friend, have
reason to rejoice at the order, seeing that several strangers
will be at your banquet this night, and it were certainly not
seemly for ladies of exalted rank to appear unmasked before
them.'
</p>

<p>
He paused awhile, noting with pleasure that his bold
glance had brought a glow to Jacqueline's delicate throat and
chin.  Then he murmured softly:
</p>

<p>
''Tis only when the strangers have departed that we, who
have the privilege of intimacy, can call on the ladies to
unmask.'
</p>

<p>
'Even you, my dear de Landas,' broke in d'Inchy curtly,
'must be content to wait until I decide to grant you special
favours.  Shall we go below, Madame?' he added, turning
to Jacqueline.  'The banquet is spread for nine o'clock.'
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline, who had scarce uttered a word since the
gentlemen entered the room, appeared almost as if she were
waking from a trance.  Her eyes had a vague, expectant
look in them which delighted de Landas, for his vanity at
once interpreted that look as one caused by his presence
and his own fascination.  But now that she encountered
her guardian's cold, quizzical glance, the young girl pulled
herself together, laughed lightly and said with a careless
shrug of her pretty shoulders:
</p>

<p>
'Nay, then, Monseigneur; 'twill not be my fault if we
are late, for I've been dressed this past half-hour, and oh!'
she added with a mock sigh of weariness, 'Ye gods!  How
bored I have been, seeing that I detest all these modish
Parisian clothes almost as much as I do a mask, and have
chafed bitterly at having to don them.'
</p>

<p>
'You would not have been bored, Madame,' riposted de
Landas with elaborate gallantry, 'had you but glanced once
or twice into your mirror, for then you would have been
regaled with a sight which, despite the cruel mask, will set
every man's heart beating with joy to-night!'
</p>

<p>
She received his formal compliment more carelessly than
was her wont, and he, quick to note every shade of
indifference or warmth in her demeanour, frowned with vexation,
felt a curious, gnawing pang of jealousy assail him.  Jacqueline
was so young, so adulated, so very, very beautiful!
This was not the first time of late that he had asked himself
whether he could hope to enchain her lasting affection, as
he had done her girlish fancy ... and had found no
satisfactory answer to the bitterly searching question.  But she,
equally quick to note his moods, quite a little in awe of
his outbursts of jealousy, which she had learned to dread,
threw him a glance which soon turned his moodiness into
wild exultation.  After which, Jacqueline turned to Nicolle,
who was standing by, gazing on her young mistress in rapt
adoration.
</p>

<p>
'Give me my fan and gloves, dear Colle,' she said.
</p>

<p>
And when Colle had given her these things, she put on her
gloves and, holding her fan in one hand and the edge of
her satin skirt with the other, she made a low curtsey before
her guardian, looking shy and demure in every line of her
young figure, even though the mask hid the expression of
her face.
</p>

<p>
'Does my appearance,' she asked, 'meet with
Monseigneur's approval?'
</p>

<p>
The answer was so obvious that M. d'Inchy&mdash;who was
somewhat nervy and irritable this evening&mdash;said nothing
but a sharp, 'Come, Jacqueline!'  Whereupon she placed
her hand upon his left arm, and without glancing again
in her lover's direction, she walked sedately across the room.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
The dining hall on the floor below was brilliantly lighted
for the occasion.  At one end of it three tables had been
laid for eighty-two guests; they were spread with fine linen
and laden with silver dishes and cut glass.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of the room the company was already
assembled: gentlemen and ladies whom Monseigneur,
governor of Cambray and the Cambrésis, desired to honour
and to entertain.  They had entered the room in accordance
with their rank, those of humble degree first&mdash;one or two
of the more important burghers of the town and their wives,
members of the municipal council and mayors of the various
guilds.  The gentlemen of quality followed next, for it was
necessary, in accordance with usage, that persons of lower
rank should be present, in order to receive those who stood
above them in station.
</p>

<p>
It would be a laborious task to enumerate all the personages
of exalted rank who filed into the stately hall, one after
another, in a veritably brilliant and endless procession.  The
Magistrate&mdash;elected by the Governor&mdash;was there as a matter
of course, so was the Provost of the City, and one or two of
the Sheriffs.  Naturally, the absence of the Archbishop and
of the higher clergy detracted somewhat from the magnificence
of the pageant, but Monseigneur d'Inchy had taken
possession of the city, the province and the Palace, and the
Archbishop was now an exile in his own diocese.  On the
other hand, the Peers and Seigneurs of the Province were
well represented: we know that Monseigneur de Prémont
was there, as well as Monseigneur d'Audencourt and
Monseigneur d'Esne and many other wealthy and
distinguished gentlemen and their ladies.
</p>

<p>
Most of the ladies wore masks, as did many of the men.
This mode had lately become very general in Paris, and the
larger provincial towns, who desired to be in the fashion,
were never slow in adopting those which hailed from the
French capital.  The custom had its origin in the inordinate
vanity of the time&mdash;vanity amounting to a vice&mdash;and which
hath never been equalled in any other epoch of history.
Women and men too were so vain of their complexions
and spent so much upon its care, used so many cosmetics,
pastes and other beautifiers, that, having accomplished a
veritable work of art upon their faces, they were loth to
expose it to the inclemencies of the weather or the fumes of
tallow candles and steaming food.  Hence the masks at
first, especially out of doors and during meals.  Afterwards,
they became an attribute of good society.  Ladies of rank
and fashion wore them when strangers were present or when
at a ball they did not desire to dance.  To remove a mask
at the end of a meal or before a dance was a sign of familiarity
or of gracious condescension: to wear one became a sign
of exalted rank, of high connexions and of aloofness from
the commoner herd of mankind.  Whereupon those of
humbler degree promptly followed suit.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
When M. le Baron d'Inchy entered the dining hall, having
Madame Jacqueline de Broyart on his arm and followed
by M. le Marquis de Landas, the whole company was
assembled in order to greet the host.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline's entry was hailed with an audible murmur of
admiration and a noisy frou-frou of silks and satins, as the
men bowed to the ground and the ladies' skirts swept the
matting of the floor.  The murmur of admiration increased
in boldness as the young girl went round the company in
order to welcome her friends.
</p>

<p>
And, indeed, Jacqueline de Broyart fully deserved that
admiration.  As you know, Messire Rembrandt painted her
a year or so later in the very dress in which she appeared
this night&mdash;a dress all of shimmering white satin and pearls,
save for the peep of delicate green and silver afforded by
the under-dress, and the dark crimson of her velvet shoes
and silk stockings.  The steel corset encased her young
figure like a breastplate, coming to a deep point well below
the natural waist, whilst round her hips the huge monstrosity
of the farthingale hid effectually all the natural grace of her
movements.  In Rembrandt's picture we see the dainty
face, round and fresh as a flower, with the nose slightly
tip-tilted, the short upper lip and full, curved mouth; we
also see the eyes, large and blue, beneath the straight
brow&mdash;eyes which had nothing of the usually vapid expression
of those that are blue&mdash;eyes which, even in the picture, seem
to dance with merriment and with joy, and to which the
tiny brown mole, artfully placed by nature upon the left
cheek-bone, lent an additional air of roguishness and of
youth.
</p>

<p>
To-night, her girlish figure was distorted by hoops of
steel, but even these abominations of fashion could not mar
the charm of her personality.  Her figure looked like an
unwieldy bell, but above the corset her shoulders and her
young breasts shone like ivory set in a frame of delicate
lace; her blue eyes sparkled with unwonted excitement,
and beneath the flickering light of innumerable wax candles
her hair had gleams of coppery gold.
</p>

<p>
But, above all, there was in Jacqueline de Broyart the
subtle and evanescent charm of extreme youth and that
delicious quality of innocence and of dependence which
makes such an irresistible appeal to the impressionable
hearts of men.  Just now, she was feeling peculiarly happy
and exhilarated, and, childlike, being happy herself she was
prodigal of smiles: the small element of romance which had
so unaccountably entered into her life with the advent of
the mysterious singer had somehow made the whole world
seem gay and bright in a way which de Landas' passionate
and exacting love had never succeeded in doing.  It had
dissipated the pall of boredom and ceremonious monotony
which was as foreign to Jacqueline's buoyant nature as was
the corselet to her lissom figure.  The light of mischief and
frolic danced in her eyes, even though at times, for a moment
or two, de Landas, who observed her with the keenness and
persistence of a jealous lover, would detect in her manner
a certain softness and languor which made her appear more
alluring, more tantalizing perhaps, then she had ever been.
</p>

<p>
As she entered the room, she gave a quick and comprehensive
glance on the assembled company.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me, Monseigneur,' she whispered in her guardian's
ear, 'has the stranger arrived?'
</p>

<p>
'The stranger?' retorted d'Inchy.  'What stranger?'
</p>

<p>
'Pardi!  Monsieur le Prince de Froidmont,' she said.
'Who else?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' replied d'Inchy with well-assumed indifference,
'the Prince de Froidmont has certainly arrived before now.
He is not a person of great consequence.  Why should you
be interested in him, my dear Jacqueline?'
</p>

<p>
To this Jacqueline made no answer, looked down her nose
very demurely, so that only her blue-veined lids could be
seen through the slits of her mask.  She drew up her slim
figure to its full height, looked tall and graceful, too, despite
that hideous farthingale.  Friends crowded round her and
round Monseigneur the governor, and she was kept busy
acknowledging many greetings and much fulsome flattery.
M. le Marquis de Landas never swerved from her side.  He,
too, wore a mask, but his was a short one which left the
mouth and chin free, and all the while that other men&mdash;young
ones especially&mdash;almost fought for a look or a smile
from the beautiful heiress, his slender hand was perpetually
stroking and tugging at his moustache&mdash;a sure sign that
his nerves were somewhat on edge.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
Monseigneur d'Inchy left his ward for a moment or two
in the midst of all her friends and admirers and drew
Monseigneur de Lalain into a secluded portion of the room.
</p>

<p>
'Well!' he began curtly, as soon as he felt assured that
there were no eavesdroppers nigh.  'He is here.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes!' said de Lalain, also sinking his voice to a whisper.
'He came early, as one who is of no account, and at once
mixed with the throng.'
</p>

<p>
'You were here when he arrived?'
</p>

<p>
'No.  But I came soon after.'
</p>

<p>
'Was there much curiosity about him?'
</p>

<p>
'Naturally,' replied de Lalain.  'Our good bourgeois of
Cambray do not often have the chance of gossiping over so
mysterious a personality.'
</p>

<p>
'But did they receive him well?'
</p>

<p>
De Lalain shrugged his shoulders and, by way of reply,
pointed to the further end of the room, where a tall figure,
richly though very sombrely dressed and wearing a mask of
black satin, stood out in splendid isolation from the rest of
the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Gilles, from where he stood, caught de Lalain's gesture
and d'Inchy's scrutinizing look.  He replied to both by a
scarce perceptible obeisance.  His keen eyes under the shield
of the mask had already swept with a searching glance over
the entire company.  Strangely enough, though the success
of his present adventure was bound up in a woman, it was
the men's faces that he scanned most eagerly at first.  A
goodly number of them wore masks like himself, but when
he drew himself up for a moment to his full height with a
movement that was almost a challenge, he felt quite sure
in his own mind that he would at once detect&mdash;by that subtle
instinct of self-preservation which is the attribute of every
gambler&mdash;if danger of recognition lurked anywhere about.
</p>

<p>
He himself had never been to Cambray, it is true, and
he was a knight of such humble degree that it was not very
likely that, among this assembly of Flemish notabilities,
some one should just happen to know him intimately enough
to denounce him as the adventurer that ne really was.
Still, the danger did exist&mdash;enough of it, at any rate, to add
zest to the present situation.  Light-hearted and careless
as always, Gilles shrugged his broad shoulders and turned
his attention to the ladies.
</p>

<p>
Here, though there also was suspicion, there was
undoubtedly keen interest.  Over the top of Monseigneur
d'Inchy's head Gilles could see at the end of the room the
group of ladies, gay in their brilliantly-coloured satin dresses
and their flashing jewels, like a swarm of butterflies, and
standing as closely together as their unwieldy hoops would
allow.  He felt that at least a score pairs of eyes were fixed
upon him through the narrow slits of satin masks, and that
murmured comments upon him and his appearance, conjectures
as to his identity and his rank, flew from many a
pair of lovely lips.
</p>

<p>
Right in the very centre of that group was a woman all
dressed in white, with just a narrow peep of pale green
showing down her skirt, which gave to her person the appearance
of a white lily on its stem.  Something immature about
the shoulders and the smooth, round neck&mdash;something shy
yet dignified about the poise of the head, suggested youth
not yet fully conscious of its beauty and its power, while
the richness of her attire and of her jewels proclaimed both
wealth and high position.  Murmurs and remarks among
the gentlemen around him soon made it clear to Gilles that
this was the lady whom he had been sent to woo.  Agreeably
thrilled by the delicate curves of her throat and breast,
he thought that he might spend some very pleasant hours
in sentimental dalliance with so fair a maid.
</p>

<p>
'We must have that mask from off your face, madonna,'
he said to himself; 'and not later than this night!  In
affairs of the heart, even by proxy, one does not like to
venture in the dark.'
</p>

<p>
So intent was he on his own meditations that he failed
to note the approach of a young cavalier, dressed in rich
garments of sober black, who suddenly addressed him in a
slightly ironical tone, which however appeared intended to
be friendly.
</p>

<p>
'You seem to be a stranger here, Messire,' the young
cavalier said lightly.  'Can I be of any service?'
</p>

<p>
He spoke French very fluently but with a slight guttural
accent, which betrayed Spanish blood and which for some
unexplainable reason grated unpleasantly on Gilles de
Crohin's ear.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Messire!' replied the latter quietly, 'I pray you do
not waste your time on me.  I am a stranger, it is true; but
as such, the brilliant picture before me is full of interest.'
</p>

<p>
'You are visiting Cambray for the first time?' asked the
other, still with an obvious effort at amiability.
</p>

<p>
'For the first time&mdash;yes, Messire.'
</p>

<p>
'In search of fortune?'
</p>

<p>
'As we all are, methinks.'
</p>

<p>
'Cambray is scarce the place to find it.'
</p>

<p>
'Is that your experience of it, Messire?'
</p>

<p>
De Landas frowned and a sharp retort obviously hovered
on his lips.  He appeared morose and captious about
something; probably the fact that Jacqueline had evinced an
extraordinary interest in the masked stranger had acted as
an irritant on his nerves.
</p>

<p>
But already Gilles appeared to have completely forgotten
his presence, had only listened with half an ear to the
Spaniard's laboured amenities.  For the nonce he was
vaguely conscious that through the slits of her mask, the
lily-like maid kept her eyes fixed very intently upon him.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur the governor,' de Landas was saying just
then, 'desires your presence, Messire.  He wishes you to
pay your respects to the noble Dame Jacqueline de Broyart.'
</p>

<p>
The name acted like magic on Gilles' temper.  He pulled
himself together and with a cool 'At your service, Messire!'
he followed de Landas across the room.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VI
</h4>

<p>
The presentation had been made.  It was very formal and
very distant; it even seemed to Gilles as if Jacqueline had
somewhat ostentatiously turned away from him as soon as
he had gone through the ceremonious bowings and kissing
of hand which convention demanded.  For a moment or
two after that, M. d'Inchy kept him in close converse,
whilst de Landas, evidently reassured by Jacqueline's
indifference toward the stranger, appeared much more
amiable and serene.  But the young Spaniard's mind was
apparently still disturbed.  He studied the other man with
an intentness which, in those days of fiery and quarrelsome
tempers, might almost have been construed into an insult.
He appeared to chafe under the man's cool confidence in
himself and M. d'Inchy's obvious deference towards one who
outwardly was of no account.
</p>

<p>
Gilles took no further notice of him; but, as he would
have told you himself, he felt an atmosphere of hostility
around him, which appeared to find its origin in de Landas'
attitude.  D'Inchy, aided by de Lalain, did his best to
dissipate that atmosphere, but evidently he, too, felt oppressed
and nervy.  Unversed in the art of duplicity, he was making
almost ludicrous efforts to appear at his ease and to hide his
profound respect for a prince of the House of France under
a cloak of casual friendliness&mdash;an elephantine effort which
did not deceive de Landas.
</p>

<p>
Gilles alone appeared unconscious of embarrassment.  His
mind was not properly enchained either to M. d'Inchy's
difficulties or to the young Spaniard's growing enmity.  His
thoughts were for ever breaking bounds, turning at every
moment to the girlish figure in the unwieldy hoops and the
white satin gown, whose merry laugh was like the twittering
of robins in the early days of spring.  Even at this moment
his attention had been arrested by a little episode which
occurred at the end of the room, where she was standing.
A little, sudden cry of pain rang out from beneath one of the
satin masks.  Some one had evidently been hurt&mdash;a prick
from a pin, perhaps, or a toe trodden on.  Anyhow, there
was the cry, and Messire Gilles would have thought nothing
more of it only that the next moment a girlish voice reached
his ear&mdash;a voice quite tearful and trembling with compassion.
</p>

<p>
'Think you it will heal?' the voice said tenderly.
</p>

<p>
And then it appeared to Gilles as if something in his
brain had suddenly been aroused, as if memory&mdash;a vague,
dreamy memory&mdash;had become quickened and like some
intangible sprite had taken a huge leap backwards into some
dim and remote past which the brain itself was still unable
to reach or to seize upon.  It was not a recollection, nor yet
a definite thought; but for one moment Gilles remained
absolutely still and was conscious of a curious, swift beating
of his heart, and a still more strange, choking sensation in
his throat.
</p>

<p>
The whole episode had occurred within the brief compass
of half a dozen heart-beats, and Gilles, when he looked once
more on Monseigneur d'Inchy, still saw that same look of
perplexity upon the Fleming's face, whilst from the group
of ladies in the distant part of the room there came only
the same confused murmur of voices of awhile ago.
</p>

<p>
So Gilles sighed, thinking that his excited fancy had been
playing him an elusive trick.
</p>

<p>
And the next moment the loud clanging of a bronze bell
proclaimed to the assembled guests that the banquet was
ready to be served.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
HOW THE QUARREL BEGAN
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Monsieur le Baron D'Inchy took his seat at
the head of the principal table; beside him sat
his ward, Madame Jacqueline de Broyart, who had M. le
Comte de Lalain on her left.  Gilles sat some little way
down one of the side tables.  Outwardly, he was a person
of no importance&mdash;a stranger, travelling incognito and
enjoying for the time being the hospitality of Monseigneur the
governor.  Maître Jehan, watchful and silent, stood behind
his master's chair.  The tables had been lavishly and
sumptuously laden with good things: a perpetual stream of
butlers, pages and varlets had walked in and out of the hall,
bringing in dish after dish and placing them upon the
boards.
</p>

<p>
The company sat down amidst much laughter and facetious
conversation, and, we take it, every intention of enjoying
their host's good cheer.  And, of a truth, it was a brilliant
assembly, a veritable kaleidoscope of colours, an almost
dazzling sparkle of jewels.  The dark doublets worn by the
men acted as foils to the vivid satins worn by the ladies.
The host and his principal guests had high-backed chairs to
sit on, but every one else sat on low stools, set very far
apart so as to give plenty of room for the display of the
ladies' dresses and their monstrous farthingales.  Indeed,
the men almost disappeared between the billows of satin-covered
hoops and the huge lace collars, the points of which
would tickle their nose or scratch their ear or even get into
their eye.
</p>

<p>
While the serving-men and wenches went the round of
the tables with serviettes over their shoulders and silver
ewers and basins in their hands, offering to the guests tepid
water perfumed with orange flower, with myrtle, lavender
and rosemary, for washing their hands, Gilles de Crohin was
watching Jacqueline de Broyart.  From where he sat, he
could see her dainty head above a forest of silver
dish-covers.  She had not removed her mask; none of the ladies
would do that till, mayhap, after the banquet was over, when
conviviality and good cheer would breed closer intimacy.
To Gilles' senses, rendered supersensitive by his strangely
adventurous position, it seemed as if that piece of black satin,
through which he could only perceive from time to time the
flash of glowing eyes, rendered Jacqueline's personality both
mysterious and desirable.  He was conscious of an acute
tingling of all his nerves; his own mask felt as if it were
weighted with lead; the fumes of rich soups and sauces,
mingled with those of wine and heady Flemish ale, appeared
to be addling his brain.  He felt as if he were in a
dream&mdash;a dream such as he had never experienced before save
once, when, sick, footsore and grievously wounded, he had
gone on a brief excursion to Paradise.
</p>

<p>
Gilles did not know, could not explain it satisfactorily
to himself, why the remembrance of a far-off, half-forgotten
dream-voice came, with sweet persistency, between him and
reality, a voice tender and compassionate, even whilst a
pair of eyes, blue as the firmament on an April morning,
seemed to be gazing on him through the slits in the mask.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
It would have been difficult for any stranger who happened
to have landed in Cambray, unacquainted with the political
circumstances of its province, to have realized, at sight of
Monsieur le gouverneur's table, that the Spanish armies were
even then ravaging the Cambrésis, and that provisions in
the city were becoming scarce owing to the difficulties which
market-gardeners and farmers had of bringing in their produce.
Gilles, who had been in the service of a Royal prince
of France and who had oft risen from the latter's table
with his stomach only half filled, was left to marvel at the
prodigality and the sumptuousness of the repast.  Indeed,
one of the most interesting documents preserved until
recently in the archives of the city of Cambray, is the account
of this banquet which M. le Baron d'Inchy, governor of the
Cambrésis, gave ostensibly in honour of the notabilities of
the province, but which, I doubt not, was really in honour of
<i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon, brother of the King of
France, who we know was present on the occasion, under
a well-preserved incognito.
</p>

<p>
And the menu!  Ye gods who preside over the arts of
gastronomy, what a menu!  Eighty-two persons sat down to it,
and of a truth their appetite and their digestion must
have been of the staunchest, else they could never have
grappled successfully with half the contents of the dishes
which were set before them.  Three separate services, an'
it please you! and each service consisting of at least forty
different dishes all placed upon the three tables at once,
with the covers on; then, at a given signal, the covers
removed, and the guests ready to help themselves as they
felt inclined, using their knives for the purpose, or else those
curiously shaped pronged tools which Monseigneur d'Inchy
had lately imported out of England, so the town gossips
said.
</p>

<p>
Ye gods, the menu!  For the first service there were no
fewer than eight centre dishes, on each an <i>oille</i>&mdash;that most
esteemed feat of gastronomic art, in which several succulent
meats, ducks, partridges, pigeons, quails, capons, all had
their part and swam in a rich sauce flavoured with sundry
aromatic substances, pepper and muscat, thyme, ginger,
basil and many sweet herbs.  Oh, the <i>oille</i>, properly cooked,
was in itself a feast!  But, grouped around these noble
dishes were tureens of partridges, stewed with cabbage;
tureens of fillets of duckling; several pigeon pies and capons
in galantine; fillets of beef with cucumbers and fricandeaus
of lard; and such like insignificant side dishes as quails
in casserole and chickens baked under hot cinders&mdash;excellent
I believe!
</p>

<p>
After the platters and dishes had become empty, the first
service was removed, clean cloths spread upon the tables&mdash;for
by this time the first ones had become well spattered
with grease&mdash;and perfumed water once more handed round
for the washing of hands.  Knives were washed too, as well
as the forks&mdash;the few of them that were used.  Then came
the second service.  Breasts of veal this time, larded and
braised, formed the centre dishes and the minor adjuncts
were fowls garnished with spring chickens and hard-boiled
eggs, capons, leverets, and pheasants garnished with quails:
there were sixteen different kinds of salads and an equal
number of different sauces.
</p>

<p>
Again the service was removed and clean cloths laid for
the third service.  A kind of dessert&mdash;little things to pick
at, for those who had not been satisfied.  Such little things
as boars' heads&mdash;twelve of them&mdash;which must have looked
magnificent towering along the centre of the table; omelettes
à la Noailles&mdash;the recipe of which, given in a cookery
book which was printed in the beginning of the sixteenth
century, does suggest something very succulent&mdash;dishes of
baked custards, fritters of peaches, stewed truffles, artichokes
and green peas, and even lobsters, sweetbreads and tongues!
</p>

<p>
Such abundance is almost unbelievable, and where all the
delicacies came from I, for one, do not pretend to say.
They were there, so much we know, and eighty-two ladies
and gentlemen must have consumed them all.  No wonder
that, after the first few moments of formal ceremonies&mdash;of
bowings and scrapings and polite speeches&mdash;tongues quickly
became loosened and moods became hilarious; wine too
and heady Flemish ales were copiously drunk&mdash;not a little
of both was spilled over the fine linen cloths and the rich
dresses of the ladies.  But these little accidents were not
much thought of these days; fastidiousness at meals had
not yet come to be regarded as a sign of good breeding, and
a high-born gentleman was not thought any the worse of for
vulgar and riotous gorging.
</p>

<p>
A very little while ago, M. d'Inchy himself&mdash;a man of
vast wealth and great importance&mdash;would have been quite
content to help himself with his fingers out of his well-filled
platters and to see his guests around his board doing the
same.  But ever since the alliance with France had been
discussed by his Council, he had desired to bring French
manners and customs, French fashions in dress, French
modes of deportment, into this remote Belgian province.
Indeed, he was even now warmly congratulating himself
that he had quite recently imported from England for his
own use some of those pronged tools which served to convey
food to the mouth in a manner which still appeared strange
to some of his guests.  The civic dignitaries of Cambray
and more than one of the Flemish nobles assembled here
this night looked with grave puzzlement, even with disapproval,
at those awkward tools which had so ostentatiously,
they thought, been placed beside their platter: French
innovations, some of them murmured contemptuously, of
which they certainly did not approve; whereupon they
scrambled unabashed with their fingers in the dishes for
their favourite morsels.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Jacqueline, silent at first, began after awhile to chatter
merrily.  Monsieur de Landas, who sat opposite to her,
having lately come from Paris, she begged earnestly for all
the latest gossip from the Court.  Madame la Reyne de
Navarre?  What was she like?  Jacqueline had heard
such marvels of her grace and of her intellect.  And the
Duc d'Anjou?  Was he as handsome as women averred?
And was he&mdash;was he really such a rogue as irate husbands
and brothers would have every one believe?  Then she
wanted to know about the fashions.  Were hoops really
growing in size or had a revulsion of feeling set in against
them, and what was the latest mode for dressing the hair?
Was it true that the new green dye specially invented by
<i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou was so unhealthy to the wearer
that many mysterious deaths had already followed its
introduction?
</p>

<p>
And all the while that she talked she affected to eat
heartily; but Gilles, who was watching her, saw that she
scarce touched a morsel, only played with her fork, the use
of which was evidently still unfamiliar to her.  From time
to time she seemed to pause in her chatter in order to gaze
across the table in the direction where he sat silent and
absorbed, somewhat isolated, as if shunned by the rest of
the company; and whenever she did so it seemed to him
as if her eyes called to him through the slits of that mysterious
mask.  After awhile, that call seemed so insistent that Gilles
had the greatest difficulty in the world to force himself to
sit still.  He wanted to jump up and to go and sit near her,
force her to remove that forbidding mask and let him see
just what kind of a face was concealed behind it.
</p>

<p>
By now, you see, his imagination had once more veered
right round and he had quite made up his mind that she
was fair to look upon.  The length of the table which
separated him from her obsessed his mood, till he felt a
perfect fever of desire and impotence coursing through his
veins.  And with this tingling of the nerves came a sense
of jealousy.  He could not see the man with whom Jacqueline
was conversing so animatedly, had only given passing
attention to Monsieur de Landas when the latter had spoken
with him.  But gossip had already reached his indifferent
ear that M. le Marquis de Landas had&mdash;at any rate at one
time&mdash;been an approved suitor for the hand of the rich
heiress, whereupon Messire Gilles became satisfied within
himself that that unpleasant feeling of dislike, which he was
feeling toward the other man, was solely on account of
<i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou, his master, over whose interests
vis-à-vis that same heiress, he&mdash;Gilles&mdash;was set here to
watch.
</p>

<p>
Still Jacqueline chattered away, and quite ten minutes
had gone by since she had cast a glance in Gilles' direction.
So he felt curious as well as angered and leaned forward in
order to get a better view of Monsieur de Landas.  He let
his eyes travel along the line of faces which he saw for the
most part only in profile: men and women, some old, some
young, some grave and sober, others frivolous, rowdy, not
a little vulgar, thought the fastidious Sire de Froidmont,
who had Valois blood in his veins and had seen a good deal
of the super-civilization of Paris.  All of them appeared
intent on devouring huge slabs of meat, and licking their
fingers for the last drops of sauce.  All, that is, except
one&mdash;the man with whom Jacqueline was conversing so gaily;
a young man, with masses of wavy black hair, a blue chin
and an oval face, which he kept resolutely turned toward
Madame Jacqueline.
</p>

<p>
'The favoured lover,' mused Gilles.  'The possibly
dangerous enemy of <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou, and spoiler of
Madame la Reyne's best laid schemes.'
</p>

<p>
The young man ate very little, but he drank copiously.
When he was not looking at Jacqueline he appeared to be
staring moodily before him and bit furiously at his nails.
</p>

<p>
'Attention, friend Gilles!' Messire said to himself.
'There's the rock against which you may well bruise your
head presently if you are not careful.  Madame Jacqueline
may, for aught I know, have a fancy for that amorous,
olive-complexioned swain, who, as soon as I begin to take
the centre of the stage&mdash;as take it I must&mdash;will become, a
fierce and cunning enemy.  I shall have to see to it that
Madame's fancy for him turns to indifference.  After that,
beware, friend Gilles!  Satan hath no finer henchman than
a rejected lover.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
As the banquet drew to its close there was little gravity
or decorum left around the festive board.  Even the oldest
and the gravest had yielded to the delights of untrammelled
gorging.  The food was excellent, the wines beyond praise;
every one knew every one else; they were all friends,
companions together, allied by political or business
interests&mdash;in many cases by blood.  The veneer of civilization as
shown by sober manners had not yet come to be thought
more necessary than good cheer and conviviality.
</p>

<p>
The heat in the room had become oppressive.  The smoke
from innumerable wax candles made a blue haze overhead,
a veil of mist which hid the high, vaulted ceiling and caused
the lights to flicker dimly.  The men had cast aside their
mantles and loosened their sword-belts; the ladies used
their plumed fans vigorously.  There was little left on the
table even of the elaborate dishes pertaining to the third
service: platters and silver épergnes were for the most
part empty; only now and again some one would lean
over and desultorily pick at a piece of lobster or a
truffle&mdash;an excuse, mayhap, for washing down the highly-spiced
food with another bumper of wine.
</p>

<p>
Conversation, loud jests&mdash;some of them both ribald and
coarse&mdash;flew over and across the tables, loud calls were made
to friends who sat far away.  The time had come for casting
off the last shred of ceremonial decorum which stood in the
way of unbridled hilarity.  The ladies, at the instance of
their respective cavaliers, had cast aside their masks one
by one, and their comely faces appeared, crimson and
steaming even beneath the thick layers of cosmetics.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline was one of the few who remained quite calm
and cool.  She plied her fan with lazy grace and kept on
her mask&mdash;despite the earnest, whispered entreaties of
M. de Landas and of a group of young gallants who had
gathered round her.
</p>

<p>
Gilles had already made up his mind to go.  He felt
stifled under his mask and the heat of the room, the heady
fumes of wine and food rendered him stupid and dizzy.
There appeared to be no chance of his being able to approach
Jacqueline again, short of provoking a quarrel with her
Spanish watch-dog, which Gilles would have thought
impolitic to do.  On the whole, he thought that it would
be best to retire for the nonce from the scene.  His day
had not been altogether unsuccessful: it was the fifth
since his arrival in Cambray, and surely Madame la Reyne
de Navarre would by now be on the track of her truant
brother.  Gilles' probation could not last many days longer,
and in the meanwhile he had definitely made up his mind
that <i>Monsieur's</i> future bride was adorable, and that she
already evinced a more than passing interest in the masked
stranger who had serenaded her so boldly from beneath her
casement-window.
</p>

<p>
Not a bad beginning, thought Messire, as he gave a wink
to Jehan to follow him and rose from his seat.  The moment
which he chose appeared a favourable one: the etiquette
of the supper table was considerably relaxed; those of
Monseigneur's guests who wished to do so had taken to
moving about from place to place, according as they desired
to speak with friends; whilst some who wished to hold
private converse together, or who were on the point of
leaving, actually walked out of the room.
</p>

<p>
This was Gilles' opportunity.  Just then Monseigneur
d'Inchy rose also.  Monsieur le Prince d'Eremberghe and
his lady were about to take their leave.  They were
personages of vast importance and the host desired to do them
special honour.  Accompanied by de Lalain, he escorted
his departing guests to the door, and thence, having the
Princess on his arm, he went out into the antechamber,
followed by de Lalain and the Prince.  He had not noticed
Gilles, and the latter stood for a moment or two in the centre
of the room, alone with Jehan, and momentarily undecided.
He surveyed the group at the head of the table with a critical
frown: the young gallants&mdash;there were six of them&mdash;were
crowding round Madame, some leaning across the table,
others pressing close to her chair.  She may have been
amused at the platitudes wherewith they were regaling
her; she may have enjoyed their conversation and M. de
Landas' ardent glances&mdash;she may have done all that, I
say, and thought no more of the man standing there alone
in the middle of the room than if he had been one of her
lacqueys.  But, as chance would have it&mdash;or was it indeed
Gilles' compelling look which drew her own?&mdash;certain it is
that she turned her head in his direction and that he <i>felt</i>
that she was regarding him quizzically, searchingly, through
the eye-slits of her mask.
</p>

<p>
Quickly he gave a few whispered instructions to his
faithful Jehan; then he calmly strode across the room.
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur the governor was still absent: his seat
beside Madame Jacqueline was empty.  Gilles walked up
the length of the table&mdash;no one heeded him&mdash;and before
any one&mdash;least of all M. de Landas&mdash;was aware of his
intention, sat down quite coolly on M. d'Inchy's vacant chair,
immediately next to Jacqueline.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
If you can imagine a cannon ball exploding in the very
centre of that festive board, you will have some dim idea
of the effect produced upon M. d'Inchy's guests by this
manoeuvre.  Every head was at once turned in that
direction, for M. de Landas and his friends had uttered an
exclamation that was almost ludicrous in its bewildered wrath.
</p>

<p>
The ladies round the supper tables could not do more
than utter shrill little screams of disapproval, and many of
the men were, alas! too deep in their cups to do aught save
mutter bibulous imprecations against the malapert.  A few
rose and ran to give the weight of their moral and social
support to de Landas, who had already jumped to his feet
and appeared ready to make of this incident a quarrel&mdash;and
that quarrel, his own.  Of a truth, it was de Landas
who had been most grievously insulted.  The vacant chair
beside Madame Jacqueline could only be taken by an intimate
friend such as he.  Already his hand was on his sword-hilt;
his eyes, somewhat dimmed by the effect of copious libations,
were rolling with unbridled fury; beneath his mask a hot
flush had risen to his forehead, whilst below the curly masses
of his dark hair his ears appeared white and shiny like wax.
Unfortunately, he, like several other gentlemen present here
this night, had drunk a vast quantity of Burgundy and
Rhenish wine, not to mention several bumpers of excellent
Flemish ale, and when choler came to mingle with the fumes
of so much heady liquor, M. de Landas on rising, turned
very giddy and had to steady himself for a moment or two
against the table.
</p>

<p>
Just at that moment a veritable pandemonium reigned in
the stately banqueting hall.
</p>

<p>
'The insolence!' said some of the ladies to the
accompaniment of piercing little shrieks.
</p>

<p>
'A stranger!'
</p>

<p>
'A prince from Nowhere at all!'
</p>

<p>
'Bah!  A Prince!'
</p>

<p>
'A mere fortune hunter!'
</p>

<p>
'Probably a Spanish spy!'
</p>

<p>
'Only a Spaniard would have such insolence!'
</p>

<p>
'Such impudence passes belief!'
</p>

<p>
The men&mdash;those who could speak coherently&mdash;sent
encouraging calls to de Landas:
</p>

<p>
'Seize him by the collar, M. le Marquis!'
</p>

<p>
'Throw him out!'
</p>

<p>
'Have him kicked out by the varlets!'
</p>

<p>
Enough noise, in fact, to break the drum of a sensitive
ear.  But Gilles appeared superbly unconscious of the storm
which was brewing round him.  He had his back to M. de
Landas, leaned an elbow on the table and faced Madame
Jacqueline as coolly as if he had been invited by every one
here to pay her his respects.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline, demure and silent, was smiling beneath her
mask.  To look at her, you would have sworn that she was
stone-deaf and heard nothing of the tumult around her.
</p>

<p>
It soon raged furiously.  M. de Landas had quickly
recovered himself.  His towering rage helped to dissipate
the fumes of wine and ale which had somewhat addled his
brain, and backed by all his friends he made preparation
to throw the malapert to the tender mercies of M. d'Inchy's
varlets, and as a preface to the more forcible proceeding,
he turned in order to smite the impudent stranger in the
face&mdash;turned, and found himself confronted by a short,
square-shouldered man, with a round head and fists held
clenched on a level with a singularly broad chest.
</p>

<p>
The man stood between Gilles and M. de Landas; he had
the table on his right and the monumental mantelpiece on
his left, and behind him was the tall carved oak back of
the chair on which Gilles was sitting&mdash;all equally strong
barriers to the young Marquis' bellicose intentions.
</p>

<p>
'Out of the way, lout!' shouted de Landas furiously,
and would have seized Maître Jehan by the collar but for
the fact that it was a very difficult thing indeed to seize
Maître Jehan by any portion of his squat person unless he
chose to allow so unceremonious a proceeding, and just now
he was standing guard between a number of enraged gentlemen
and the back of his master's chair&mdash;a trying position,
forsooth, for any man of Maître Jehan's prowess, for
... well! he would not have dared to lay hands on such a great
gentleman as was M. le Marquis; but, against that, M. le
Marquis had no chance of laying hands on Maître Jehan
either.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VI
</h4>

<p>
And all the while, Gilles sat so near to Jacqueline that
his knees touched the hoops of her skirt.  Instinctively she
drew her own chair back with that same little demure air
which was apparent in every one of her movements, even
though her face was concealed by the mask.
</p>

<p>
'An' you move an inch further, fair one,' he said boldly,
'I vow that I shall be ready to commit a crime.'
</p>

<p>
'You are committing one now, Messire,' retorted Jacqueline.
'A crime against decorum, by sitting in my guardian's
place.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I'll no longer sit&mdash;I'll kneel at your feet,' he riposted,
and made a movement as if to push away his chair.
</p>

<p>
'Heaven forbid!' she exclaimed lightly.  'M. de Landas
would kill you!'
</p>

<p>
'I am not so easily killed,' he rejoined.  'And M. de
Landas is, for the moment, engaged with my man.'
</p>

<p>
'Who is getting sorely pressed, Messire!' cried Jacqueline
with sudden, eager excitement.  'Will you not go to his
aid?'
</p>

<p>
She had caught sight of Jehan, standing with his back to
his master's chair, fists levelled, shoulders squared, defying
not only M. de Landas but a crowd of other gentlemen,
who had rushed forward to support their friend.
</p>

<p>
'Not before you have promised to unmask, fair one,'
Gilles said calmly.
</p>

<p>
'I?' she exclaimed, now really staggered by his cool
impudence.  'You are dreaming, Messire!'
</p>

<p>
'I think I am, Madame,' he replied; 'therefore I must have
your promise ere I wake.'
</p>

<p>
'You are presumptuous!'
</p>

<p>
'Just now you said that I was dreaming.  A man who
dreams is a man asleep&mdash;and a man asleep is too helpless
to be presumptuous.'
</p>

<p>
'That is sophistry, Messire,' she retorted.  'And while
you parley thus idly, your man is in serious danger through
the wrath of these gentlemen.'
</p>

<p>
'My good Jehan's danger is not so pressing as mine.  He
hath my orders to hold these gentlemen at arm's length until
I give the word, whilst Monseigneur d'Inchy may be back
any moment before I wake up from my dream.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' she urged now with well-feigned alarm.  'But your
poor man cannot stand long before these gentlemen, and
you, Messire, will surely not allow him to receive all those
knocks which are intended for you!'
</p>

<p>
'I have received many a score which were intended for
him,' retorted Gilles with a laugh.  'Jehan and I have
long ceased to reckon up accounts.  Your promise, fair
one,' he pleaded; 'ere Monseigneur return to place a
spoke in my wheel!'
</p>

<p>
She felt now as if she were trapped, no longer combated
his desire, but merely appeared anxious to gain time until
her guardian came to release her from the strange,
compelling power of this man, who was arrogating unto himself
rights which could only be claimed by a friend or lover.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, mon Dieu!' she exclaimed agitatedly, half rising
from her chair in her eagerness to catch sight of Jehan.
'He cannot long parry the attack&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Your promise, fair one,' he insisted quietly, 'to let me
see your sweet face to-night!  I swore it to myself just
now, when you threw me a glance across the room, that I
would look into your eyes untrammelled.  Your promise!&mdash;or
I vow that I'll do something desperate!'
</p>

<p>
'Heavens above!' she exclaimed, keeping her attention
deliberately fixed on Maître Jehan.  'If he should strike one
of these gentlemen&mdash;he&mdash;a mere servant!...'
</p>

<p>
'If he does,' riposted Gilles lightly, 'I will take up his
quarrel, with this token tied to my sword-hilt.'  And from the
inner pocket of his doublet he drew a tiny, perfumed rag,
held it in his hand and waved it with an ostentatious flourish
for her to see.
</p>

<p>
She gave a quick, involuntary little cry of alarm: 'My
handkerchief!'
</p>

<p>
'Undoubtedly, fair one!' he said coolly.  'It hath your
initials and crown embroidered in the corner!  Think you
Messire de Landas' choler will cool at sight of it?'
</p>

<p>
Her forehead, her tiny ears, her neck and chin, everything
that he could see of her dainty face, had become
suffused with a warm blush.
</p>

<p>
'Messire!' she said firmly, 'I command you to give me
back that handkerchief, which you stole unawares.'
</p>

<p>
'It was flung at me with a sheaf of lilies, which, alas! have
withered.  'Tis my right hand which shall wither ere
I part from the handkerchief.'
</p>

<p>
'My handkerchief!' she reiterated impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'Only with my life!  But it shall lie for ever hidden
against my heart if you will promise...'
</p>

<p>
'Messire, you are committing a base and unworthy act!'
</p>

<p>
'I know it,' he said with a smile.  'But I must have that
promise.'
</p>

<p>
'Promise of what?' she asked breathlessly, driven into
a corner by his obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
'To let me look straight into your eyes to-night,' he said,
'unfettered by that hideous mask.'
</p>

<p>
He leaned forward so that his face now was quite close
to hers, and he could feel her quick breath against his
cheek.
</p>

<p>
'No, no!' she said with a little gasp.  'My
guardian&mdash;and&mdash;and M. de Landas&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Very well!' he said dryly, and began quietly winding
the little rag around his sword-hilt.
</p>

<p>
'Messire!' she said in a peremptory tone, through which
a note of appeal, if not of genuine alarm this time, could be
distinctly perceived.
</p>

<p>
'Promise!' he reiterated relentlessly.
</p>

<p>
Just then she caught sight of de Landas, who, flushed
with choler, was thrusting somewhat wildly at Maître Jehan.
She thought that his eyes were constantly wandering in her
direction and that he was vainly trying to get near her,
past his sturdy opponent, who was guarding the approach
to his master's chair with all the fierceness of a Cerberus.
Somehow, at sight of de Landas thus fighting with almost
savage violence, she lost her head for the moment.  Of a
truth, the matter of the handkerchief might lead to a very
bitter quarrel between her lover and this stranger.  A very
bitter quarrel&mdash;and worse!  De Landas was wont to lose
all self-control when jealous rage had hold of him, was as
quick with his dagger as with his rapier!  And here was
this tantalizing troubadour calmly preparing to flaunt upon
his sword-hilt the handkerchief which bore her name and
coronet.  He looked up and caught the sparkle of her eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Promise!' he insisted quite coolly.
</p>

<p>
And she&mdash;very reluctantly&mdash;murmured: 'Very well;
I promise!'
</p>

<p>
'To-night!' he insisted.
</p>

<p>
'No!&mdash;no!' she protested.  'Not to-night!'
</p>

<p>
'To-night!' he reiterated firmly, smiled at her too beneath
his mask as if in triumph&mdash;Oh, the insolence of him!&mdash;and
continued to toy with the compromising bit of white
rag.
</p>

<p>
If only Monseigneur would return!  There was nothing
for it but to acquiesce.  De Landas even then looked the
very image of wild and unreasoning fury.  Jacqueline
shuddered and murmured a quick: 'Very well!  To-night!  I
promise!'
</p>

<p>
Gilles gave an equally quick sigh of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
'When?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
But before she could reply, there came a loud curse
from Jehan.  He had been seized round the legs by two
varlets, even while he was engaged in warding off the blows
which were aimed at his head by half a dozen gallants.  It
was when he came down with a dull thud upon his knees and
felt that he could no longer stand between his master and
these evil-intentioned gentlemen that he gave forth a
prolonged and uproarious stutter:
</p>

<p>
'The d-d-d-d-d&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Gilles jumped to his feet.  In less than three completed
seconds he was round by the side of Jehan, had kicked the
two varlets out of the way and interposed his massive person
between his faithful henchman and the seething group of
bellicose gallants.
</p>

<p>
'Silence, chatterbox!' he said coolly to Jehan.  'These
seigneurs are not here to listen to your perorations.
Anything that must be said can be referred to me.'
</p>

<p>
He had one hand on the elegant hilt of his Spanish rapier;
the other rested on the shoulder of Maître Jehan, who had
struggled very quickly to his feet.  His mocking glance, veiled
by the black satin mask, swept coolly over de Landas and his
friends.
</p>

<p>
'Insolent!' exclaimed one of the men.
</p>

<p>
'Unmask the spy!' cried out another.
</p>

<p>
'Leave the rogue to me!' quoth de Landas, who was
getting beside himself with rage.
</p>

<p>
Already half a dozen swords were drawn.  Every one
who had been drunk before became sobered in the instant;
those who had remained sober felt suddenly drunk with
choler.  Some of the ladies thought it best to scream or
to feign a swoon, others made a rush for the door.  No one
dared to come nigh, for de Landas was a man who was not
good to trifle with when his ire was aroused.  But those who
were not taking part in the quarrel were certainly not eyeing
the stranger with any degree of benevolence, and Jacqueline
felt more than she actually heard the adverse comments
made upon this Prince de Froidmont&mdash;so he was styled, it
appeared&mdash;who had come no one knew whence and who
seemed to arrogate unto himself privileges which only
pertained to favoured friends.
</p>

<p>
Thus a wide circle was formed at one end of the room,
leaving at the other, in splendid isolation, the group which
was made up of half a dozen young gallants standing in
threatening attitudes in front of the masked stranger, who
now had his henchman on one side of him and on the other
the monumental mantelpiece, in which the fire had been
allowed to die down.
</p>

<p>
'Out of the way, malapert!' cried de Landas savagely
to Gilles, as he advanced towards him with sword clutched
and eyes that glowed with a fierce flame of unbridled wrath.
His desire was to reach Jacqueline, who stood a little way
behind Gilles, near the table, watching in an attitude of
tense excitement the progress of this quarrel, and with an
eye on the door through which she hoped every moment
to see her guardian reappear.
</p>

<p>
But, quick as lightning, Gilles had barred the way.  He
appeared highly amused and perfectly at his ease, laughed
boldly in M. de Landas' heated face; but would not let him
pass.
</p>

<p>
It was easy to perceive that he was enjoying this quarrel,
loved to see the glint of those swords which threatened him
even while they promised to vary the monotony of this
sentimental adventure.  He had not drawn his own.  In
France, fighting in the presence of ladies was thought highly
unseemly.  These Flemings were different, very uncouth, not
a little brutal and abominably hot-headed.  Well! the quarrel
once begun would of a surety not end here and now, even
though M. d'Inchy were to return and peremptorily order
it to stop.  There was something in M. de Landas' sullen
and defiant attitude which delighted Gilles: and when half
a dozen irate gentlemen shouted hoarsely, 'Out of the way!'
he laughed and said:
</p>

<p>
'Impossible, Messeigneurs!  'Tis for you to retire.  Our
gracious hostess will grant me the favour of unmasking.
An' I am much mistaken, she will not do the same for
you.'
</p>

<p>
'Madame Jacqueline,' retorted de Landas hotly, 'will not
unmask before the first jackanapes who dares to approach
her unbidden.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! but I am not unbidden,' riposted Gilles gaily.  'Have
I not told you that Madame will deign to unmask ere I bid
her good-night?'
</p>

<p>
'Insolent coxcomb!' shouted the other excitedly.
</p>

<p>
'A spy!' cried one of the others.
</p>

<p>
'Tear off his mask, de Landas!  Let us see the colour
of his skin!'
</p>

<p>
'An impudent rogue!' added a third.
</p>

<p>
'M. le Marquis de Landas,' here interposed Jacqueline
peremptorily, 'you forget that M. le Prince de Froidmont is
our guest.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' retorted de Landas with a sneer, 'if he is under
the protection of the ladies...'
</p>

<p>
'Under no protection save that of my sword, Messire!'
broke in Gilles carelessly.  'And that will be entirely at
your service as soon as I have taken leave of our fair hostess.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay! that you shall not do!' riposted de Landas.
'Your impudent assertion of awhile ago has put you outside
the pale.  You shall not take your leave!  'Tis we who'll
throw you out; unless you relieve us of your company
now&mdash;at once!'
</p>

<p>
'Well said, de Landas!' came in an approving chorus
from the irate group of de Landas' friends.
</p>

<p>
'We'll throw him out!' cried some of them.  'Leave him
to us.'
</p>

<p>
'A spy!' came from others.
</p>

<p>
'Now, Messire&mdash;whoever you may be,' concluded de
Landas with ironic emphasis, 'will you go willingly or shall
my friends and I&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'For shame, Messire!' broke in Jacqueline loudly and
firmly.  'You are six against one&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'So much the better!' riposted de Landas with a harsh
laugh.  'At him, friends!'
</p>

<p>
'Madame,' said Gilles, turning to Jacqueline with perfect
calm, 'your promise will remain for ever unredeemed if
these gentlemen succeed in throwing me out of the room;
for this, I vow, they cannot do while I am alive.'
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline,' interposed de Landas impulsively, 'I forbid
you to unmask before this man.'
</p>

<p>
He had guessed her purpose, for already her hand was
raised towards her mask; and so enraged was he that she
should thus yield to this stranger whom already he had come
to hate, that he forgot himself, lost all self-control, and said
just the one word which decided Jacqueline.  At the word
'forbid,' she drew herself up to her full height and faced
her lover with calm and hauteur.
</p>

<p>
'There is nothing,' she said coolly, 'that any one here
has the right to command or forbid.'  Then she turned to
Gilles: 'I'll bid you good-night now, Messire, and can but
offer to you&mdash;a stranger&mdash;my humble apologies in mine and
my guardian's name for the uncouth behaviour of my
countrymen.'
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline!' exclaimed de Landas with a hoarse cry of
rage.
</p>

<p>
But even before this final protest had reached her ear,
she had extended one hand to Gilles and with the other
slowly detached the mask from her face.  He had stooped
very low in order to kiss her finger-tips; when he straightened
out his tall figure once more he was face to face with her.
</p>

<p>
He never spoke a word or made a sign.  He did not look
into her eyes at first, though these were as blue as the skies
in Southern France; he did not gaze at the delicate mouth
with the deep corners and the roguish smile, or at the
chiselled, slightly tip-tilted nose with the sensitive nostrils
that were quivering with excitement.  No! all that Messire
Gilles gazed on at the moment was a tiny brown mole which
nestled tantalizingly on the velvety cheek, just below the
left eye.  And for that moment he forgot where he was,
forgot the storm of enmity which was raging around him,
the unworthy rôle which he had set out to play for the
deception of a confiding girl.  He lost count of time and of
space and found himself once more lying on cool,
sweet-smelling straw, with a broken wrist and an aching head,
and with a vision as of an angel in white bending over his
fevered brow and murmuring in tones of exquisite
compassion, 'Think you it will heal?'
</p>

<p>
And as he gazed on that little mole, that veritable kissing-trap
which had tantalized him long ago, his lips murmured
vaguely:
</p>

<p>
'My dream!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VII
</h4>

<p>
Of course the little interlude had all occurred within a
very few seconds: the kiss upon the soft, warm hand, the
look upon that roguish face, the swift and sudden rush of
memory&mdash;it had all happened whilst poor M. de Landas
was recovering from the shock of Jacqueline's cold rebuke.
Her stern taunt had come down on him like a hammer-blow
upon the head; he felt dazed for a moment; speechless,
too, with a white rage which was too great at first for words.
But that kind of speechless fierceness seldom lasts more
than a few seconds.  Even as Gilles de Crohin was quietly
collecting his scattered senses and Jacqueline, vaguely
puzzled, was readjusting her mask in order to be able to
gaze on him unobserved, marvelling why he should have
murmured 'My dream!' and looked so strangely at her,
de Landas had recovered some measure of self-control.  The
anger which he felt against the stranger was no longer
impetuous and ebullient; it had become cold and
calculating, doubly dangerous and more certain to abide.
</p>

<p>
He put up his sword, motioned to his friends to do
likewise&mdash;which they did, murmuring protestations.  They were
itching to get at the stranger who had triumphed so signally
over them all.  But de Landas was waiting with apparent
calm whilst Gilles took leave of Jacqueline.  This Gilles did
with all the ceremony which etiquette demanded.  He still
felt dazed with the strange discovery which he had just made,
the knowledge that the dream which he had only cherished
as a vague memory was a living, breathing, exquisite reality.
Ye gods! how exquisite she was!
</p>

<p>
But he had no excuse for lingering&mdash;had, on the other
hand, a wild desire to be alone, in order to think, to
remember and to dream.  So, having bowed his last farewell, he
turned to go, and found de Landas barring his way.
</p>

<p>
'You will pay for this outrage, Messire,' said the latter
in a quick whisper through his set teeth.
</p>

<p>
'Whenever you please,' replied Gilles imperturbably.
</p>

<p>
'To-night&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Surely not while ladies are present,' broke in Gilles
quietly.
</p>

<p>
''Tis in Madame's presence,' retorted de Landas roughly,
'whom you have insulted, that I and my friends&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Messire!' protested Jacqueline firmly.
</p>

<p>
'Ah! a valorous half-dozen then?' rejoined Gilles lightly.
'I see that you&mdash;and your friends, Messire&mdash;have no
intention of taking any risks.'
</p>

<p>
'Our intention is to tear that mask off your impudent
face and make you lick the dust at Madame Jacqueline's
feet.'
</p>

<p>
'And mine,' riposted Gilles gaily, 'is to collect a trophy
of half a dozen masks&mdash;yours, Messire, and those of your
friends&mdash;on the point of my sword and to place these with
my homage at Madame Jacqueline's feet.'
</p>

<p>
'Insolent!'
</p>

<p>
'I therefore am completely at your service, gentlemen,'
concluded Gilles, with an ironical bow directed at his
opponents.  'Whenever, wherever you please.'
</p>

<p>
'Here and now!' broke in de Landas, whose self-control&mdash;never
of long duration&mdash;had already given way.  'At
him, friends!  And, by Satan, we'll teach this malapert
a lesson!'
</p>

<p>
It was in vain that Jacqueline tried to interpose; in vain
that the ladies about the room screamed and swooned,
that the men even began loudly to protest.  Neither de
Landas nor his friends were in a state to hear either
commands or protests.  All decorum, chivalry, breeding, was
thrown to the winds.  Hatred had descended like an ugly
night-hawk upon these young gallants, and with her frowzy,
sable wings had enveloped their brain and hearts till they
were deaf to the most elementary dictates of honour.  With
de Landas, a wild, insensate jealousy had fanned that hatred
to a glowing brazier of unreason and of madness.  He
saw&mdash;or thought he saw&mdash;that Jacqueline displayed unwonted
interest in this stranger, that her eyes followed his
movements with anxiety not unmixed with admiration.  And
de Landas became conscious of a red veil before his eyes
and of a furious desire to humiliate that man first and to
kill him after.
</p>

<p>
'At him, friends!' he called again hoarsely.  'We'll
teach him a lesson!'
</p>

<p>
It was most fortunately at this very moment, and when
the tumult was at its height, that Monseigneur d'Inchy
re-entered the room.  Just for a second or two he did not
pay much heed to the noise.  In these days, when political
and religious controversies oft raged with bitter acrimony,
it was not very unusual that a hot quarrel marred the close
of a convivial gathering.  D'Inchy at first did not do more
than glance round the room, to see if his interference was
really necessary.  Then, to his horror, he realized what was
happening, saw <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou, own brother to
the King of France and future Sovereign Lord of the Netherlands,
standing in the midst of a group of young hotheads,
who were actually threatening Monseigneur the governor's
exalted guest!
</p>

<p>
And de Landas, that impetuous quarrelsome young
coxcomb, was talking of giving <i>Monsieur</i> a lesson!  It was
unbelievable!  Appalling!  D'Inchy was a middle-aged
man, but it was with a degree of vigour which many young
men might have envied that he pushed his way through
the jabbering and gesticulating throng of men and women,
right across the room to the top of the table, where he
arrived just in time to avert what would indeed have been
a terrible calamity.
</p>

<p>
'By Heaven, M. de Landas,' he interposed stoutly, ''tis
I will teach you and these gentlemen a lesson which you
are not like to forget!'
</p>

<p>
And, regardless of de Landas' and his friends' glowering
looks, he pushed his way to Gilles' side and stood facing
that angry little crowd who, suddenly abashed, drew back
a step or two, muttering wrathful expletives.  Monseigneur,
of course, was their host and an old man; but why should
he interfere and spoil what promised to be really fine sport?
</p>

<p>
'M. le Prince de Froidmont is my guest,' M. d'Inchy went
on calmly.  'Who quarrels with him, insults me and my
house.'
</p>

<p>
A real sigh of relief came from Madame Jacqueline.
Already, at sight of her guardian, she had felt reassured,
and now he had voiced just what she had wished to say
all along.  She felt grateful to him for this and for his
dignified attitude, and with a pretty, clinging gesture, sidled
up to him and took hold of his arm.
</p>

<p>
What could the young gallants do?  They were helpless
for the moment, even though still raging with choler.
De Landas tried to look as if nothing of importance had
happened, even though from beneath his mask he shot a
last glance of hatred and menace at his unperturbed enemy.
The others quickly followed suit and for the moment the
incident was at an end.  Fortunately it was not likely to
have unpleasant consequences, for already Gilles had
interposed with his habitual good-humour.
</p>

<p>
'Your pardon, Monseigneur,' he said.  'These&mdash;these
gentlemen and I had no intention of insulting one another.
We were only having a little argument, and as your
hospitality hath been over-lavish, we became somewhat
heated; that is all!'
</p>

<p>
'Somewhat heated!' riposted d'Inchy gruffly.  'With
mine own ears I heard M. le Marquis Landas here...'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, that's just it!' broke in Gilles imperturbably.
'M. de Landas and I were indulging in a friendly argument,
which your presence, Monseigneur, at once rendered futile.'
</p>

<p>
M. d'Inchy sighed with relief.  Gilles' coolness was
contagious; even de Landas ceased to growl and the others
to mutter.  Thank Heaven! the quarrel was fizzling out
like an unfanned flame, and in any case Monsieur was taking
the situation with perfect good-humour.  D'Inchy, bent,
as always, on conciliation, smiled with impartial blandness
on every one, whilst Jacqueline, silent and demure now as
if nothing had happened, was once more looking straight
down her nose.  D'Inchy took hold of her hand, which still
rested upon his arm, and patted it gently with an indulgent,
fatherly caress.
</p>

<p>
'Then all is for the best, Messeigneurs,' he said, 'and
with your leave my ward will now take her leave of you.  I
fear me that your friendly argument has somewhat fatigued
her.  By the way,' he added lightly, 'you have not yet
told me what that argument was about.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' rejoined Gilles with a quiet smile, 'we only argued
as to whose should be the privilege of placing a trophy at
the feet of our fair hostess.'
</p>

<p>
'A trophy?  What trophy?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, something quite insignificant.  A&mdash;a mask&mdash;or half
a dozen&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Just like so many 'prentices a-quarrelling,' said d'Inchy
with gruff good-humour.  'A mask or half a dozen, forsooth!
You'd far better all be going to bed now.  Madame
cares nothing for your masks or your trophies.  She is too
tired for any such nonsense.  Eh, Jacqueline?'
</p>

<p>
'Not too tired, Monseigneur,' replied Jacqueline demurely,
'to forgo the pleasure of bidding you good-night ere you
go to rest.'
</p>

<p>
'There, you see, gentlemen,' rejoined d'Inchy gaily,
'that age has certain privileges which youth seeks for in
vain.  Whilst you go moodily, unsatisfied, to bed, the fairest
of the fair will be sitting with her old guardian in his
living-room, prattling away on the events of this night, quizzing
you all, I'll warrant; laughing at your quarrels and your
trophies.  Is that not so, my dear? ... One mask or half
a dozen! ... Are they not like children, these gallants,
with their senseless quarrels?  But there, while women
are beautiful, men will quarrel for their favours&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
And he looked down with fatherly pride on the golden
head which was kept so resolutely bent.
</p>

<p>
'C'est entendu, Monseigneur,' replied Jacqueline softly.
'I'll come to your living-room as usual and bid you
good-night after all our guests have departed.'
</p>

<p>
Far be it from me even to hint that, as she said this,
Jacqueline threw more than a cursory glance on Gilles or
on M. de Landas, for nothing could have looked more demure,
more dignified and aloof than she did at this moment, when,
having spoken, she bowed with stiff grace to the group of
gentlemen before her.  And even Maître Calviac would have
felt that he was a mere bungler in the matter of bowings
and scrapings if he could have seen these gallants responding
to Madame's salute; the right leg outstretched, the
left foot kept back, the hand almost touching the floor with
a wide sweep of the arm, then brought back to the lips as
for an imaginary kiss.
</p>

<p>
The next moment Jacqueline had turned and presently
could be seen, still with that same stiff grace, receiving the
adieux of her guardian's guests.  She held her small head
very erect and with one hand plied her fan with lazy
nonchalance, whilst the other was perpetually being extended
to those whose privilege it was to kiss it.
</p>

<p>
As for the group of young gallants&mdash;well! they had the
immediate future to look forward to.  True, that for the
nonce they were forbidden to continue the quarrel for fear
of incurring their host's displeasure; but it was only a
matter of putting off the happy hour when one could be
even with that insolent stranger.  De Landas turned with
a significant gesture and a knowing wink to his friends.
After that, the small group dispersed and ostentatiously
mingled with the rest of the departing crowd.
</p>

<p>
D'Inchy, before he left Gilles' side, managed to murmur
fulsome apologies.
</p>

<p>
'I do assure Monseigneur,' he whispered earnestly in
Gilles' ear, 'that these young jackanapes will not be tempted
to repeat their impudence, and that I...'
</p>

<p>
'And that you, Messire,' broke in Gilles a little impatiently,
'are entirely innocent of any intention of offending me.
That is, of course, understood.  Believe me,' he added
gaily, 'that the little incident was more than welcome as
far as I am concerned.  Your lavish hospitality had made
us all drowsy.  M. de Landas' aggressive temper brought
life and animation into the entertainment.  I, for one, am
grateful to him for the episode.'
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later he too had taken leave of his host.
Jacqueline he did not see again.  She was entirely
surrounded by friends.  Nevertheless, he left the banqueting
hall in a state of exhilaration, and as he passed through the
doors between the rows of Monseigneur's obsequious serving-men,
they all remarked that Monsieur le Prince de Froidmont
was humming a lively tune, the words of which
appeared to be:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Les plis de sa robe pourprée<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et son teint au vostre pareil!'<br />
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
AND HOW IT ENDED
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
When Gilles de Crohin found himself alone with Maître
Jehan in the corridor which led straight to the
main entrance hall, he paused for a moment, irresolute,
wondering what he had best do.  That there had been
murder in the eyes of that gallant Marquis de Landas no one
could doubt for a moment, and there lay a long stretch of
dark streets and narrow lanes between the Archiepiscopal
Palace and the safe shelter of 'Les Trois Rois.'
</p>

<p>
But you cannot imagine Messire Gilles de Crohin quaking
even for a moment at the thought.
</p>

<p>
'Careful we must be,' he said in a whisper to his faithful
<i>alter ego</i>; 'for my choleric friend will not, I imagine, be
above lying in wait for us within the shelter of a convenient
doorway, and I should ill serve the cause of the Queen of
Navarre by getting spiked between the shoulders at such
an early stage of the proceedings.  But between that and
showing that gallant Spaniard a clean pair of heels and
foregoing the pleasure of threading his mask on my blade, there
is a world of difference; eh, my good Jehan?'
</p>

<p>
'Above all things,' he added to himself, under his breath,
so that even Jehan could not hear, 'I must find out whether
a certain provoking glance, which flashed from out a pair of
the most adorable blue eyes I have ever seen, were intended
for me or not.'
</p>

<p>
And his thoughts flew riotously back to Jacqueline&mdash;Jacqueline,
his dream, his tantalizing, exquisite dream&mdash;Jacqueline
of the blue eyes and the captivating mole&mdash;Jacqueline
of the roguish smile and the demure glance.
</p>

<p>
'I wonder, now!' he murmured softly.  Had she
perchance meant to give him a hint?  Had she thrown him a
warning glance?  Gilles just then could have sworn that
she had done both when she spoke of Monseigneur's living-room,
where she would sit prattling after the last of the
guests had departed.
</p>

<p>
'Did she mean me to take refuge there against de Landas'
murderous intentions?' he asked himself.  But the
supposition did not appear likely.  Gilles was no coxcomb and
had not had many dealings with women during the course
of his chequered career; but he had an innate respect for
them, and would not credit Jacqueline&mdash;proud, demure,
stately Jacqueline&mdash;with the intention of offering a gratuitous
rendezvous to an unknown gallant.  Rather was her glance
intended for de Landas&mdash;the assignation was for him:
'perhaps,' thought Messire Gilles with a vague stirring of
hope in his heart, 'perhaps with a view to keeping that
fiery lover of hers out of harm's way, till I myself was safely
abed.'
</p>

<p>
Be that as it may, the most elementary dictates of
prudence demanded that he should go back to his hostelry
before his enemies had time to concoct any definite plans
for his undoing.  So, calling to Jehan to follow him, he
found his way quickly out of the Palace.
</p>

<p>
It was raining heavily just then; the streets were dark
and, after a while, quite deserted.  Gilles and Jehan,
keeping a sharp look-out around them, walked rapidly and kept
to the middle of the streets.  Fortunately for them both,
they had had plenty of leisure in the last four days to wander
through the intricate by-ways of the Flemish city.  They
knew the lay of the land pretty well by now, and at this
moment when the thought of a possible <i>guet-apens</i> was
foremost in their minds, they were able to outwit any
potential assassin who might be lurking on the direct route
by going to the hostelry along devious ways usually
unfrequented by strangers.
</p>

<p>
Thus it took them nearly half an hour to reach 'Les Trois
Rois,' and Jehan, for one, was heartily congratulating
himself that those murderous gentlemen had been comfortably
thrown off the scent and were mayhap cooling their tempers
somewhere in the cold and the wet, when, just as they
entered the porch of the hostelry, a shadowy figure detached
itself from out the gloom.
</p>

<p>
Gilles was already prepared with a quick, 'Qui va là?'
but the figure proved inoffensive-looking enough: a woman,
wrapped in a mantle and hood from head to foot.  She had
a small roll of paper in her hand, and this she held out
timidly to Gilles.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont?' she inquired
under her breath.
</p>

<p>
'Myself,' replied Gilles curtly.  'What is it?'
</p>

<p>
He took the paper and unrolled it.  By the light of a
small lanthorn which hung just inside the porch he saw that
it was a letter&mdash;just a few lines&mdash;written in a small, pointed
hand, and signed with the letter 'J.'
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline!' he murmured, bewildered&mdash;so dazed
that it took him some time before he was able to read.
At last he deciphered the brief message.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
'I do entreat you, Mesire,' it ran, 'to return to the palace
within the hour.  Nay! I do not entreat, I command!  Go to
the postern Gate: you will find it unlatched.  Then cross the
Courtyard till you come to a door on the left of the main
Perron&mdash;this will be unlocked.  You will find yourself in one of the
chief Corridors which give on the grand Staircase.  Remain
there concealed, and await further Orders.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A strange enough missive, of a truth, and one, no doubt,
which would have made an older and more prudent man
pause ere he embarked on so dubious an adventure.  But
Gilles de Crohin was neither old nor prudent, and he was
already up to his neck in a sea of adventure which had
begun to submerge his reason.  Even before he had folded
up the paper again and slipped it into the inner pocket of
his doublet, he had made up his mind that no power on earth,
no wisdom or warning, would deter him from keeping the
tryst.  Did I think to remind you that he was no coxcomb?
Well! he certainly was absolutely free from personal
vanity, and it was not his self-conceit which was stimulated
by the mysterious message; rather was it his passion for
adventure, his love for the unforeseen, the unexpected, the
exhilarating.  The paper which he hid so tenderly inside his
doublet had a delicious crisp sound about it, which seemed
to promise something stimulating and exciting to come.
</p>

<p>
'Run up, Jehan,' he called to his man.  'I follow you.
Let me get out of these damnable slashed and puffed rags&mdash;these
velvet shoes and futile furbelows.  Up, man!  I follow
in a trice!  We have not done with adventure yet to-night.'
</p>

<p>
Then he turned, with a piece of silver in his hand ready
to reward the bearer of such joyful tidings.  But the
messenger had disappeared into the night as quietly, as
mysteriously as she had come.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Less than half an hour later, Gilles de Crohin once more
found himself within the precincts of the Archiepiscopal
Palace.  He had been so quick in changing his clothes and
so quick in covering the distance which separated him from
the trysting place, that he had no occasion to use the
postern gate or the small door which had been indicated to
him.  The great entrance portals were still wide open when
he arrived; some of the corridors still thronged with
people&mdash;guests of Monseigneur and their servants on the point of
departure&mdash;whilst others appeared entirely deserted.  At
one point, Gilles caught sight of M. de Landas taking
elaborate leave of a group of ladies.  He had his usual circle
of friends around him, who&mdash;a moment or two later&mdash;followed
him out of the Palace.
</p>

<p>
Gilles, with Jehan close behind him, kept well within
the shadows, away from the throng.  He had exchanged
his elaborate and rich costume for a suit that was both
plain and sombre; he had washed the perfume out of his
hair and the cosmetics from off his hands.  He felt unfettered
in his movements now and in rare good humour.  The only
thing which he had borrowed from his former accoutrement
was the magnificent Toledo rapier, which, after a moment's
hesitation, he had buckled into his own sword-belt.  It had
been a parting gift from Madame la Reyne de Navarre and
was a miracle of the steel-worker's art; supple as velvet,
it would bend point to hilt like a gleaming arc and when it
caught a ray of light upon its perfect edge, it flashed a
thousand coloured rays like a streak of vivid lightning in
a storm-laden sky.
</p>

<p>
Jehan, on the other hand, was not altogether at his ease.
Having less cause to feel exhilarated, he had a greater
mistrust of the mysterious missive, had vainly tried to argue
prudence where his master would only hearken to folly.
But he had never succeeded in getting beyond a laboured:
'I th-th-th-think&mdash;&mdash;'  Upon which, he was peremptorily
ordered to hold his tongue, even while Messire went merrily
singing to face this questionable adventure.
</p>

<p>
At one point Gilles stopped in order to speak to a serving-man,
asked him to tell him where was Monseigneur's private
apartments, and when the man appeared to hesitate&mdash;for
indeed he did not like to give this information to a
stranger&mdash;Messire had seemingly lost his temper, and the man,
trembling in his shoes, had stammered out the necessary
directions.  Monseigneur's private apartments and those
of the household were in the right wing of the Palace.  This
was reached by mounting the grand staircase, then continuing
along the main corridor which connected the different
portions of the vast building, until the wing containing the
living-rooms was reached.  No one, the man went on to
explain, slept in this portion of the Palace, which held only
the reception rooms and one of the chapels; but there
were always night-watchmen about the place to see that
no malefactors were about.
</p>

<p>
Whilst the man spoke, Jehan felt as if his eyes were
searching him through and through.  The worthy soul was
liking this adventure less and less every moment.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, very soon after this all the corridors became
deserted.  Singly, in pairs, or in groups, all Monseigneur's
guests and their servants had taken their departure.  For
awhile the varlets and wenches belonging to the household
were busy clearing up the disorder and the débris attendant
on so large a gathering and on so copious a supper, and one
could hear them jabbering and laughing in the distant
dining hall or in the offices down below.  Then that noise,
too, became stilled, and one felt that this portion of the
vast Palace was indeed completely uninhabited.
</p>

<p>
Up at the Town Hall, the belfry of Martin et Martine
had just chimed the midnight hour.  Messire Gilles and his
faithful Jehan found themselves in the vast hall at the foot
of the grand staircase, and the main entrance with its
monumental gates was then immediately behind them.  A
strange stillness reigned all around: the great Palace seemed
here like a city of the dead.
</p>

<p>
Jehan vainly tried to protest once more.  For what
was Messire waiting, he wondered.  Surely it was unwise
and worse to linger here now, when every one had gone
and all servants were abed.  Presently, of course, the
night-watchmen would be making their rounds.  Jehan
had a swift and exceedingly unpleasant foreboding that he
and his master would be ignominiously turned out! and
then God alone knew in what rows and quarrels they would
be involved, or how hopelessly they would jeopardize their
own position; not to speak of the Queen of Navarre's
cherished scheme.  Poor Jehan would have given five
years of his life and half his savings for five minutes' glib
speech with his master.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Even at this very moment, Jehan's vague terrors took on
a definite form.  Footsteps and voices raised in merry
converse were heard, resounding from the distance, and the
next instant two serving-men carrying torches came leisurely
down the corridor in the direction of the hall.  Immediately
behind them walked Monseigneur the Governor, who had
Madame Jacqueline on his arm.  Jehan felt as if his heart
had stopped its beating; his knees shook under him, whilst
tiny drops of perspiration rose at the roots of his hair.
</p>

<p>
Ye gods! if they were discovered now!  They would
be under grave suspicion of evil intent ... burglary
... assassination....  There had been talk at the banquet
of 'spy' and 'Spaniard.'  Jehan's scanty hair stood up
on end with horror.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Messire was equally aware of danger, gave
a quick glance round, and perceived a door close beside
him on the right.  This part of the hall was, equally luckily,
in shadow.  There was also just sufficient time to reach
the door, to open it, and to step incontinently behind it,
closing it again noiselessly.  Phew! it had been a narrow
escape!
</p>

<p>
The footsteps and the voices came rapidly nearer; a
minute or two later they passed within a foot of the door
behind which Gilles and Jehan were crouching, hardly daring
to breathe.  The glint of the torches could be distinctly
seen through a narrow chink between two panels, as well
as the shimmer of Madame's white satin gown.  There
were but a few inches of wood and a foot of floor-space
between Messire and shameful discovery, and Maître Jehan
fell to wondering what particular form of torture would be
applicable to a man who was found lurking at dead of
night in the dark, and with obviously evil designs on the
life or property of the governor of a Flemish province.
</p>

<p>
Thank Heaven and all the protecting angels, however,
the footsteps passed by, and presently were heard ascending
the main staircase, and whilst Maître Jehan was feeling
as if his whole body would melt in a sea of cold perspiration,
Madame Jacqueline's rippling laughter came only as an
echo from a considerable and comparatively safe distance.
</p>

<p>
After awhile Gilles ventured to open the door very
cautiously.  A faint murmur of people stirring came from
very far away; the shuffling footsteps of the torch-bearers
died away in the distant corridors.
</p>

<p>
And once more all was still.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Gilles gave vent to his feelings by a long-drawn-out
'Phew!' of obvious relief; but the next moment he said,
quite coolly:
</p>

<p>
'Pardi, my good Jehan! but we did not want to be
caught hiding in this place like a couple of malefactors,
did we?' and made straightway to re-open the door.
Jehan seized him by the arm and clung to him with all
his might.
</p>

<p>
'Why shouldn't we st-st-st-stay here?' he urged almost
glibly.
</p>

<p>
Gilles shrugged his shoulders.  'Why not, indeed?' he
retorted.  'Something has got to happen presently,' he
added carelessly.  'Somebody has got to come.  If it is
not Madame Jacqueline&mdash;and, honestly, my good Jehan,
I have small hopes of that&mdash;If it is not Madame, then&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He paused and frowned.  For the first time a sharp
suspicion had crossed his mind.  Had he proved himself to
be a vanity-ridden coxcomb after all?  Should not the
most elementary prudence have dictated....?  Bah! whatever
prudence had dictated, Gilles would not have
listened.  He was out for adventure!  Whether gallant
or dangerous he did not care!  Once more he shrugged his
broad shoulders and unconsciously his slender hand gripped
the hilt of his splendid Spanish sword.
</p>

<p>
He threw a quick glance around him.  Through the open
door, the huge metal lamps which illumined the hall beyond
threw a wide shaft of golden light into the room where he
and Jehan had found such welcome refuge.  It appeared
to be something of a boudoir or library, for the shaft of
light revealed rows of books, which lined the walls all round.
There was a window at the far end of the room, and that
was closely curtained, and there was no other door save the
one through which the two men had entered.  The fire in
the large open hearth had been allowed to die down.  A
massive desk stood not far from the window, and there
were a few chairs about and a small, iron-bound coffer.
Papers littered the desk and a finely wrought candelabra
hung from the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
'The room,' said Gilles lightly, 'looks as if it had been
closed for the night.  There is no reason why we should
not await here the future course of events.'  He drew one
of the chairs into a comfortable position and sat down,
then added: 'I do not know, of course, how long we may
have to cool our heels in this place, until the writer of the
mysterious epistle chooses to explain his or her commands.
I am beginning to think, as you do, my friend, that the
missive should have been signed with an "L" rather than
with a "J".  What say you?'
</p>

<p>
'Aye!  Aye!' muttered Jehan.
</p>

<p>
'Well, 'tis no matter!  I'd as soon meet mine ebullient
friend of the languorous eyes to-night as to-morrow, and
inside this deserted Palace as out there in the rain.  And
a little sword-play would be very stimulating after the
sentimental dalliance of the last few days.'
</p>

<p>
'H'm!' murmured Jehan equivocally.
</p>

<p>
'In the meanwhile, there is no reason why we should
not have a rest.  I confess to feeling rather sleepy.  Just
take a last look at the corridor,' concluded Gilles, as he
stretched his long limbs out before him.  'And if you are
satisfied that all is well, come and join me in an excursion
to the land of Nod.'
</p>

<p>
Jehan went to the door as he was told and peered
cautiously to right and left of him.  Seeing nothing suspicious,
he went as far as the great hall to listen if all was
clear and still.  It was whilst he was gone that something
arrested Gilles' attention.  Furtive footsteps this time&mdash;a
number of them&mdash;moving stealthily along the corridor.
With a quick gesture, he adjusted the mask over his
face&mdash;instinct led him to do that first and foremost; then he
jumped to his feet and went to the door, but had no time
to step across the threshold, for the next instant a compact
group of moving figures emerged straight in front of him
out of the gloom, intercepting him and barring the way.
</p>

<p>
'À moi, Jehan!' he called aloud.
</p>

<p>
But it was too late.  From the hall beyond there came
the sound of a vigorous scuffle.  Jehan, caught unawares,
was putting up a good fight seemingly against heavy odds;
but he could no longer reach his master&mdash;whilst some
half-dozen gentlemen, all wearing masks, were pushing their
way into the room.
</p>

<p>
'We've run our fox to earth at last, Messeigneurs,' came
with a mocking laugh from out this dense and aggressive-looking
group.  'And without cooling our heels in the
wet&mdash;what?  I told you that this would be the better plan.
His own egregious vanity hath led him straight into our
trap and 'tis mighty fine sport that we'll have with this
abominable spy, without fear of interruption.'
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of M. de Landas, unmistakable owing to
the slight guttural pronunciation of the French language
peculiar to his Spanish blood.  Before Gilles could forestall
him, he and his friends were all around him: six of them,
fine young gallants&mdash;those who had supported de Landas
in the quarrel after the banquet.
</p>

<p>
Gilles surveyed them all with a rapid glance, measured
his own position, which of a truth was not an advantageous
one.  The light from the lamps in the hall fell, through
the open doorway, full upon him, whilst his aggressors
appeared only like a dense mass in the heart of the shadow.
They were evidently intent on forcing him back into the
room; their movements appeared like part of a concerted
plan of action, to get him into a corner where they could
more comfortably hold him at their mercy.
</p>

<p>
Gilles realized his position, the danger in which he stood
and his best chance of defence, with the unerring rapidity
of a born soldier.
</p>

<p>
'It must have taken a huge effort of intelligence, Messire,'
he said ironically, 'to concoct this pretty plan.  What was
there in an open challenge to frighten so many stalwart
gallants?'
</p>

<p>
He gave ground, retreated into the room while he spoke.
De Landas and his friends pressed in closely after him.
</p>

<p>
'I have yet to learn,' retorted the young Spaniard with
a sneer, 'that you are worthy of crossing swords with one
of us.  You may draw, an' you have a mind; but you cannot
escape the lesson which I and my friends have vowed to
administer to you, and which, forsooth, you have so richly
deserved.'
</p>

<p>
''Tis no use,' he added with an intaking of the breath
like an angry snake, ''Tis no use calling for help.  The
night-watchmen are in my pay: my own men have settled
with your servant, and no sound short of an earthquake
could reach the distant wing of the Palace where Monseigneur
and his household are abed.'
</p>

<p>
He drew his sword, and his friends immediately did likewise.
Still they advanced, the solid phalanx of them, and
so cunningly that Gilles was kept in the shaft of light whilst
they remained under cover of the shadow.
</p>

<p>
'A murder!' said Gilles quietly.
</p>

<p>
'A lesson, first and foremost,' was de Landas' curt reply.
'After that, we shall see.'
</p>

<p>
'What shall we see, Messire?' riposted Gilles with a
mocking laugh.  'A Spanish cavalier stooping to
assassination&mdash;&mdash;?'
</p>

<p>
'Who spoke of assassination?' queried one of the gallants.
</p>

<p>
'Why else are you here?' retorted Gilles, 'the six of
you, whilst half a dozen or more of your varlets are
overpowering my man outside, after ye have bribed or threatened
the watchmen into silence?  Methinks it looks uncommonly
like projected murder.'
</p>

<p>
'Whatever it is,' broke in de Landas savagely, 'it will
be a lesson which you are not like to forget.'
</p>

<p>
'The lesson of how to lay an ignoble trap for an
unsuspecting foe?  A lesson, indeed, in which the teacher is
well-versed in infamy.  The assignation; the forged
signature!  The watchmen bribed, a dozen of you to attack two
men, and, as you say, the wings of the Palace where our
host and his servants lie abed, well out of earshot.  My
compliments, M. de Landas!  I have met much knavery
in my time, but none, I think, quite so cleverly devised.
France, it seems, hath still a great deal to learn from Spain,
and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He had not yet drawn in response to the other's challenge,
but stepped back and back until he was almost up against
the desk at the far end of the room.  Then, suddenly, with
a movement so swift that his antagonists were taken
completely unawares, he skipped behind the desk and with a
push of his strong arms threw it down straight at his assailants,
forcing them in their turn to give ground or the massive
piece of furniture would have fallen on the top of them.
As it was, it came to the ground with a crash, the noise
as it fell being to a certain extent subdued by the thickness
of the matting which covered the floor.
</p>

<p>
When de Landas and his friends recovered from the
suddenness of this unexpected shock, positions for them were
unpleasantly reversed.  They were now in full light, a good
target for an experienced swordsman, whilst Messire le
Prince de Froidmont lurked somewhere in the shadow.
Fortunately he was comfortably outnumbered, and his
henchman quite helpless by now; to disarm him and give
him the long promised chastisement was only a question of
time.
</p>

<p>
'And I have sworn,' cried de Landas spitefully, 'to
deposit at Madame Jacqueline's feet the mask which still
hides his impudent face.'
</p>

<p>
Gilles, however, was determined to sell his life or his
discomfiture dearly.  He had not been slow in consolidating
his new position.  Losing not one second of precious time,
he drew the overthrown desk close to him, picked up a
couple of chairs that were close by, then reached out for
two or three more, piled these up over and around the desk,
and by the time de Landas and his crowd had recovered
their bearings and returned to the attack, he was
magnificently ensconced behind a barricade of heaped-up furniture,
and, having drawn his sword, was ready for defence.
</p>

<p>
'Now, Messeigneurs,' he said with those same mocking
tones which had already exasperated de Landas beyond
endurance, 'see to it that you escape well-merited chastisement;
for, on my oath, I swear that 'tis I who will deposit
half a dozen masks at Madame Jacqueline's feet ere I give
you a chance of carrying out that nice little murder plot
which was destined to cover six stalwart seigneurs with glory.'
</p>

<p>
De Landas gave a harsh laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Your ruse will not protect you,' he said, 'though I
confess 'twas well manoeuvred.  À moi, friends!  'Twill
not be the first time that you have aided me in extirpating
noisome vermin from its hidden burrow.  You, La Broye,
and du Prêt, hold the right; Herlaer and Maarege the left;
de Borel, you and I wherever we are needed, and en avant.
At him, friends!  No barricade on earth nor protecting
darkness shall save him from the punishment which he hath
so richly deserved.  At him, and unmask the rogue, so
that I can at last smite the impudent spy in the face!'
</p>

<p>
De Borel, young, impetuous, a fiery nincompoop, easily
led by the nose by his more brilliant friend, was not slow
in following the lead given him.  He and Herlaer made a
swift rush for the improvised barricade whilst de Landas
attacked in the centre and the others, with equal vigour,
both on right and left.  They thrust their swords somewhat
wildly through the interstices provided by the legs of the
chairs which towered above the overturned desk, lunged
blindly into the darkness, for they could not see their
opponent.  For a few minutes all was confusion&mdash;the din of
clashing steel, the hoarse cries of the assailants, and Gilles'
ironical taunts as he parried all these aimless thrusts with
the coolness of a consummate swordsman&mdash;all merged into
a chaotic uproar.  The next moment, however, Herlaer
went down, and then de Borel, each with a deep gash in
the leg, which had ripped up the flesh from the ankle to
midway up the calf.
</p>

<p>
The front of the desk happened to be kidney-shaped,
and it was through the aperture formed by that front as
it lay on its beam end that Gilles' sword had suddenly darted
out once and then again, like some vicious snake, with
maddening rapidity and stealth, inflicting the sharp flesh
wounds which had so disconcerted his assailants.  They,
entirely taken unawares, irritated by this attack from a
wholly unforeseen quarter, not only fell back with some
precipitancy, but also with a marked cooling off of their
primary ardour.  They had come straight from a festive
gathering, were wearing silk hose and low shoes of velvet,
and at this moment were wishing that their ankles had
been protected by substantial leather boots.  Somewhat
sulkily they set to to staunch their wounds with their
lace-edged handkerchiefs.  De Landas watched them with
a scowl, giving the while a short respite to his opponent&mdash;the
latter, of a truth, well ensconced behind his barricades,
was more difficult to get at than had at first been supposed.
</p>

<p>
There ensued a hasty council of war.  Herlaer, limping,
was despatched for reinforcements.  The varlets who had
effectually dealt with Jehan might as well come and lend
a hand to dress their masters' wounds.  Jehan, indeed,
lay prone upon the flagstones of the hall, having apparently
succumbed to a blow on the head, of which one of those
same varlets was even now boasting with inordinate
vainglory to his companions, when they were all incontinently
called away to attend upon the young seigneurs.
</p>

<p>
De Landas in the meanwhile had returned to the assault.
Leaving Herlaer and de Borel in the hands of their
henchmen, he called the others lustily to him.
</p>

<p>
'À moi, du Prêt, Maarege, La Broye!' he cried.  'Beware
of the fox's underground burrow, and en avant!'
</p>

<p>
He had espied the small coffer, seized it by one of its
handles and dragged it across the floor.  Aided by Maarege,
they succeeded in placing it in position so as to block the
aperture below the barricade.  Now there was no longer
any danger from that quarter; the enemy was getting foiled
at every turn.  And with renewed valour they once more
rushed to the assault.
</p>

<p>
Gilles now was on his feet, ensconced in the angle of the
wall, so as to allow his sword arm full play; and indeed,
in his skilful hands the magnificent Toledo blade seemed
like a living, breathing thing&mdash;a tongue of steel which darted
in and out of the improvised barricade, forward, to right,
to left, parry, en garde, thrust, lunge&mdash;out of the darkness,
now and then only catching a glint of light upon its smooth
surface, when it would flash and gleam like a streak of
vivid lightning, to subside again, retire, disappear into
the gloom, only to dart out again more menacing, more
invincible than before.
</p>

<p>
And every time that this tongue of living flame shot out
of the darkness it left its searing trail behind.  Maarege
was bleeding from the shoulder, du Prêt from the thigh;
La Broye had a gash across the forehead, and de Landas'
forearm was torn from the wrist to the elbow.  On the other
hand, de Landas' sword was also stained with blood.  He
gave a cry of triumph.
</p>

<p>
'À moi, de Borel!  Herlaer!' he called to the other two.
'At the barricades, while we keep the rogue busy.  He
cannot hold out much longer!'
</p>

<p>
And, indeed, the combat was far too unequal to last.
One man against six, and his only ally was the darkness.
That too was failing him, for his assailants' eyes were
becoming accustomed to the gloom.  They were able to descry
him more easily than before, and there was not a mean
swordsman amongst them, either.  Even now, under cover
of a vigorous onslaught made by de Landas and his three
seconds, de Borel and Herlaer&mdash;their wounds temporarily
dressed&mdash;rushed for the barricade and dragged first one
chair and then the other away, and finally succeeded in
throwing the two others right into Gilles' legs, thus
hampering the freedom of his movements.  True, that during this
rapidly executed manoeuvre, de Borel received a gash across
the cheek and Herlaer a thrust in the arm; but the solitary
fighter's position had been rendered decidedly more
precarious.
</p>

<p>
'Throw up your hands, you fool!' exclaimed de Landas
with grudging admiration at his opponent's swordsmanship.
'Unmask, and go your way, and we will call quits over
this affair!'
</p>

<p>
Gilles' only reply to the taunt was an ironical laugh.
The chairs encumbered his legs, but his sword arm was
free, and he had once been counted the finest swordsman in
France.  Attack and parry again, thrust and en garde&mdash;six
blades menaced him, and he, ensconced in the dark
angle, kept the six of them at bay!  Now du Prêt's sword,
with a vigorous blow, was knocked clean out of his hand;
anon Maarege's blade was broken in two close to the hilt.
</p>

<p>
Confusion now reigned supreme.  Fight and excitement
had whipped up the blood of all these young gallants till
a perfect fury of hatred for the invincible opponent drew
a blood-red, veil-like mist before their eyes.  The frantic
desire to kill was upon them; their wounds no longer
ached, their arms felt no weariness; the breath came with
a hissing sound through their quivering nostrils.  Now
Maarege and La Broye succeeded in further demolishing
the barricade, dragging away the table, overthrowing the
chairs, making the way clear to right and left of these for
a concerted attack upon the foe.  Gilles, quick as a bird
that scents an attack, skipped over the obstacle, darted to
the right, where the curtained window was, and shadows
still hung dark, almost impenetrable.
</p>

<p>
Already he was en garde again, close to the window this
time&mdash;seemed still fresh and full of vigour though bleeding
from more than one wound.  He loved this fight, as a
hungry man loves the first morsel of food which a kindly hand
places before him; loved it for its excitement&mdash;one of the
keenest he had ever sustained.  De Landas' fury stimulated
him, maddened jealousy was so obviously its mainspring;
and Gilles felt as if he were fighting for the possession of
Jacqueline.  His fine Toledo blade filled him with joy&mdash;at
this very moment it pierced de Borel's thigh as easily
as it would have done a pat of butter.
</p>

<p>
'There's for one of you!' exclaimed Gilles in triumphant
exhilaration.
</p>

<p>
De Borel was now out of action, and La Broye was
weakening perceptibly; but du Fret had recovered his
sword and Maarege was brandishing the broken stump of
his rapier, whilst de Landas, drunk with jealousy and with
rage, returned to the assault again and again, heedless of
his wounds.  The room was a mass of wreckage.  Overturned
furniture, broken débris, scraps of silken doublets
and velvet mantles, shoulder knots, tassels and bits of
priceless lace, littered the floor; the matting in places showed
dark crimson stains and had become slippery under the
ceaseless tramp of feet.  With his barricade all tumbled
about him, Gilles was more open to attack, for there were
still four of them at least against him, and they pressed
him closely enough just now.
</p>

<p>
'At him, friends!' de Landas contrived to shout, in a
voice rendered husky with exhaustion.  'At him!  The
rogue is weakening rapidly!  One more effort, and we have
him!'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, by God!  Ye have not!' exclaimed Gilles lustily,
and parried with dazzling skill an almost simultaneous attack
from de Landas and Herlaer on one side and Maarege and
du Prêt on the other.  They fell on him with redoubled
energy, wellnigh frenzied by the seeming invincibility of
their foe, their own impotence.  They had thought to make
sure of victory, had come in their numbers to administer
humiliation and correction, and now were half crazy with
impending defeat.  And so vigorous became their attack,
so determined were they to bring that hated foe to his
knees, that it seemed for the moment as if he must succumb,
as if only some sort of magic could save him.
</p>

<p>
But for a man of Gilles' temperament there could be no
such thing as defeat.  Defeat for him meant humiliation,
which he could not tolerate, and the failure of Madame la
Reyne's cherished plan.  He was not only defending his
life now, but her schemes and her happiness.  His perfect
blade accomplished miracles of defence; again and again
his enemies returned to the charge.  But that blade lived;
it breathed; it palpitated with every thrust and every
parry, swifter than lightning's flash.  Now it was du Prêt's
turn to stagger under a slashing cut on the shoulder, whilst
La Broye was almost swooning with loss of blood.
</p>

<p>
'For two!  And for three!' cried Gilles with a laugh.
'Three more of you, and I have done!'
</p>

<p>
With a cry of rage de Landas turned to the serving-men
who, appalled by the fury of this combat, were cowering
together in a far corner of the room, hardly daring to breathe.
</p>

<p>
'Here, Jan!' he shouted hoarsely.  'Peter!  Nikolas!
All of you!  Seize that man!  Fall on him!  Seize him!
At him!  At him, I say!'
</p>

<p>
For just the fraction of a second the men shrank away
still further into the angle of the room, terrified at the
uncontrolled rage which had prompted the monstrous and
cowardly command.  They hesitated but only for one
instant, and during that instant there was breathing time
for all.  But the next, egged on by de Landas' threatening
commands, they gathered themselves together and came
forward at a rush.
</p>

<p>
Gilles at once saw this new, this unexpected source of
danger.  The utter cowardice of this fresh attack lent him
strength and power to act.  With one of those swift,
masterful gestures of his which were as unexpected as they were
unerring, he threw aside his sword and seizing one of the
heavy chairs which lay prone close by, he raised it above
his head and brandishing it like a gigantic swivel he stood
there, towering, menacing, breathing hatred too now against
the dastardly foe who could thus outrage every canon of
chivalry and of valour.
</p>

<p>
He struck out with the heavy chair, to right, to left.
The varlets paused, really terrified.  De Landas egged them
on, prodded them with his sword.  He had wandered so
far now on the broad road of infamy, he was ready to go
on to its ignominious end.
</p>

<p>
'Fall on him, Jan!  Nikolas!  All of you, you abominable
knaves!' he cried huskily.  'Fall on him; or by
Satan, I'll have you all hanged to-morrow!'
</p>

<p>
He beat them with the flat of his sword, kicked them and
struck at them with his fist, till they were forced to advance.
The heavy chair came down with a crash on the head of
one man, the shoulder of another.  There were loud curses
and louder groans; but numbers were telling in the end.
One more assault, one more rush, and they were on him.
Then Gilles, as if by instinct, felt the folds of the heavy
window curtain behind him.
</p>

<p>
To gain one second's time, he threw the chair straight
at the compact mass of men, disconcerting the attack;
then with both hands he seized the curtain, gave it a mighty
wrench which brought it down in a heaped up medley of
voluminous folds and broken cornice, and threw the whole
mass of tangled drapery on his onrushing foes.  De Landas,
who was in the forefront of the aggressors, was the first
to lose his footing.  Already weak with loss of blood, he
stumbled and fell, dragging one or two of the varlets with
him.  The edge of the cornice struck du Prêt on the head
and completed the swoon which had already been threatening
him, whilst Maarege, dazed, uncomprehending, stared
about him in a state of semi-imbecility.
</p>

<p>
The other knaves, paralysed by some kind of superstitious
fear, gazed on him open-mouthed while Gilles, still
moved only by the blind instinct of self-preservation,
extricated himself from his newly-improvised stronghold.
</p>

<p>
His first instinctive act was to stoop in order to pick
up his sword again.  A momentary lull&mdash;strange and weird
in its absolute stillness had succeeded the wild confusion
of awhile ago.  Gilles staggered as he straightened out his
tall figure once more, was at last conscious that even his
splendid endurance had been nigh to breaking point.  There
was a mist before his eyes, through which he could vaguely
perceive a cowering group of lacqueys quite close to him,
huddled up together almost at his feet in the gloom; others,
whose vague forms could be discerned under the fallen
tapestry: further on, de Borel, lying helpless beside
Herlaer; Maarege still clutching his broken sword; La Broye
in a swoon, lying across the upturned desk, and de Landas,
half-sitting, half-reclining, on an overthrown chair, obviously
struggling against dizziness, his hand outstretched, with
convulsed fingers that still threatened and pointed at the
hated foe.
</p>

<p>
For the moment Gilles could not move.  The mask on
his face scorched his brow and cheeks as if it had been made
of hot iron, and yet, though he longed to tear it off, his
arm, from sheer exhaustion, refused him service.  He longed
to get out of that door, to find Jehan; but his limbs felt
as if they were weighted with lead: his very brain was in
a state of torpor.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
Just then, through that semi-conscious state, he heard
swift footsteps approaching down the main staircase, then
across the hall.  The serving-men, almost blind with terror,
heard them too, crouched yet closer together in the gloom.
They dragged themselves along the floor, nearer to Gilles,
as if for protection.  Experience had taught the poor
wretches that, whatever else happened, they would be made
to suffer for all that had occurred.  True, they deserved
all that they would get, for they too had played an ignoble
part; but whatever else happened there would be floggings
or worse for them.  Their employers were too weak now
to protect them even if they would.  M. le Marquis, enraged
at defeat, would perhaps be the first to give his men away.
So they gathered round Gilles now&mdash;round the man whom
they had helped almost to murder.  They clung to him
in their sheer, unreasoning cowardice&mdash;the instinct to get
behind something that was still stalwart and strong.  They
crawled away into the shadow, out of sight of Monseigneur's
serving-men if these should come, of the night-watchmen
or of the Palace guard if they appeared upon the scene.
</p>

<p>
Thus Gilles, when he tried to move towards the door,
could not do so because of that cringing mass of humanity
that clung, terror-stricken, round his legs.  He was too
utterly weary to kick them all aside, so he remained quite
still, listening to those approaching footsteps.  One of
these he could have sworn to&mdash;heavy, and with a slight
dragging of the feet&mdash;which could only have belonged to
Jehan.  He tried to call to his faithful henchman, but his
throat was so dry he could not utter a sound.
</p>

<p>
The footsteps were quite close now, and through the
open doorway he could see that a new and flickering light
threw every nook of the corridor into bold relief.  A
torch-bearer was coming along; other lighter footsteps followed,
and anon it seemed as if a woman's satin skirts swept the
marble floor with its melodious frou-frou.
</p>

<p>
Gilles now was in a trance-like state on the borders of
unconsciousness, a state wherein the body's utter exhaustion
seems to render the mental perceptions abnormally acute.
He could only stand and gaze at the open doorway; but
he knew that in a very few seconds she would appear.  He
knew that it was she who was coming: she and Jehan.
Old Jehan had found her and brought her along, and now
that he&mdash;Gilles&mdash;was weary and sick she would minister
to him and tend him as she had done that night, long ago,
in what still seemed to him so like a dream.
</p>

<p>
The next moment the second half of the folding door
was flung open and a torch, held aloft by a serving-man,
threw a flood of light into the room.  Immediately afterwards,
under the lintel of the door, Jacqueline appeared,
just as Gilles had expected her to do, like a vision of the
angel of peace, in her shimmering white satin gown, with
the pearls round her neck and her crown of golden hair.
She had no mask on, and even through the veil which seemed
to hang before Gilles' eyes he could see that tantalizing little
brown mole which gave such exquisite, roguish charm to
her face and made of the angel vision a living, perfect piece
of adorable womanhood.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline de Broyart was not the sort of woman who
would faint at sight of blood.  Her country had suffered
too much and too long for her to have remained ignorant
and detached from all the horrors which perpetual warfare
against tyranny and intolerance had sowed broadcast upon
the land.  She had ministered to the sick and tended, the
wounded ever since her baby hands had been strong enough
to apply a bandage.  But at sight of this disordered room,
of the ghastly faces of these men&mdash;ghastly above their
blood-stained masks&mdash;of de Landas' weird, convulsive
gesture, of Maarege's attitude of vacant imbecility, of all
the litter of stained floor and soiled bits of finery, she recoiled
with an involuntary cry of horror.  The recoil, however,
was only momentary; the next, she had come forward
quickly, a cry of pity this time upon her lips.  Her first
thought was for de Landas&mdash;the friend, the playmate, the
lover.  She hurried to him, hardly looked on Gilles, who
could not move or call, who tried not to stagger or to fall
headlong at her feet.
</p>

<p>
Now Jacqueline had her arms round her lover, his head
rested against her shoulder, soiling the white satin of her
gown with ugly crimson stains.  But that she did not heed.
She could not conjecture what had happened!  That stuttering,
stammering creature, himself half dazed and bruised,
had found his way to Monseigneur's living-room, had in
incoherent language implored her to come.  Monseigneur
happened to be absent from the room at the moment, had
gone to give orders to one of his servants.  Jacqueline
was alone, sitting by the hearth waiting for him when the
creature came.  She knew him for the henchman of the
Prince de Froidmont, the man who had fought so valiantly
to defend his master awhile ago in the banqueting hall.
She could see that he was hurt and in grave distress and
gathered from his confused stammer that something awful
was happening somewhere in the Palace.  She followed him
without any hesitation, and now through that medley of
hideous sights which confronted her in this room, the most
vivid thing that struck her gaze was de Landas' convulsive
gesture, pointing at Gilles.
</p>

<p>
Already, with a few quick words, she had despatched the
torchbearer for assistance.
</p>

<p>
'Go, Anselm!' she said, 'and rouse Nicolle and two of
my women.  Tell them some gentlemen are hurt and that
I order them to come hither at once and to bring all that
is necessary for the dressing of wounds.  And&mdash;stay!' she
added in a tone of peremptory command.  'Not a word
to Monseigneur or to his men&mdash;you understand?'
</p>

<p>
The man nodded in quick comprehension, fixed the torch
into the wall-bracket and went.  As soon as he had gone
Jacqueline turned back to de Landas, pillowed his aching
head upon her bosom and held his poor, trembling hand in
her strong, warm grasp.  Then only did she turn to look
on Gilles.
</p>

<p>
He appeared unhurt, or nearly so.  True, his doublet
was stained&mdash;he might have received a scratch&mdash;and he
bore about his person that unmistakable air of a fighting
man who has been in the thick of a fight; but amongst
these other fallen and fainting men he alone was standing&mdash;and
standing firmly, on his feet.  And he had a group of
men around him, all of whom were quite obviously unhurt.
They looked like his henchmen, for they crowded close
behind him, looking up to him as to their master.
</p>

<p>
So, whatever had happened&mdash;and Jacqueline gave an
involuntary shudder at the thoughts and conjectures which
were crowding into her brain&mdash;whatever else had happened,
the stranger had had plenty of minions and varlets with
him to defend him, even if he had been set upon by de
Landas and his friends.
</p>

<p>
It were easy to blame Jacqueline for the utterly false
interpretation which she had put on what she saw; but
de Landas was the friend, the playmate, and&mdash;yes!&mdash;the
lover; whilst Gilles was only a stranger and an adventurer
at best.  Strangers were both feared and hated these days
in this unfortunate, stricken country, that was tyrannized
over and cowed by conquerors of alien blood; and though
Jacqueline was shrewd enough to suspect de Landas and
his companions of the treachery which they had indeed
committed, yet in her mind she half-excused him on the
plea that the Prince de Froidmont had been unchivalrous
and timid enough to have his person guarded by a gang of
paid varlets.  Thus it was that the look which she threw
on Gilles was both contemptuous and unpitying.
</p>

<p>
'I pray you, Messire,' she said coldly, 'to leave my
guardian's house, ere I call to him to demand of you an
explanation which I imagine you are not prepared to give.'
</p>

<p>
Her words, her look, were so different to what Gilles had
expected that, for the moment, he remained absolutely
speechless.  He certainly had not his wits entirely about
him, or he would not, after that one moment of silence,
have burst into a harsh and prolonged laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Messire!' reiterated Jacqueline, more peremptorily,
'I have desired you to go, and to take your varlets along
with you, ere they swoon with the excess of their terror.'
</p>

<p>
'Your varlets!'  Gilles laughed more loudly than
before&mdash;indeed, he felt that he could no longer stop himself
from laughing now until he dropped down dead on the
floor.  Jacqueline was leaning over de Landas and saying
something to him which he&mdash;Gilles&mdash;could not very well
hear, but her whole attitude, the look wherewith she regarded
the wounded man, sent such a pang of insensate jealousy
through Gilles' heart that he could have groaned aloud with
the misery of it.
</p>

<p>
'I entreat you, my beloved,' de Landas murmured more
audibly after awhile, 'to go back to your apartments.  This
is no place for you, and my friends and I will struggle
homewards anon.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot leave you like this, José!' she broke in firmly.
'Not while&mdash;while that man and his varlets are here!'
</p>

<p>
Ye gods! the humour of the situation!  No wonder
that Gilles could not cease laughing, even though his side
ached and his head felt like splitting with pain.  But he
obeyed her commands, peremptorily ordered the cowering
group of knaves to go; and they, thankful to escape,
rushed helter-skelter for the door.  Probably they never
understood what the noble lady had been saying, and they
were too stupid with terror to say aught in protest.  Whether
M. le Marquis de Landas, who had employed them for this
night's work, would pay them liberally on the morrow, as
he had promised, or have them flogged for failing to murder
the stranger, still remained to be seen.  For the moment,
they were only too thankful to escape with their skins whole.
Jehan, who much against his will had been forced to remain
at attention behind the door, relieved his feelings by giving
each of them a vigorous kick ere they started to run madly
down the corridor.
</p>

<p>
While the last of them was stumbling over the threshold
Gilles managed to pull himself together sufficiently to stop
that paroxysm of ungovernable laughter.
</p>

<p>
'Have no fear, Madame,' he contrived to say with
moderate coherence and a full measure of contemptuous
irony, 'I'll not harm M. le Marquis de Landas or his five
gallant friends, on mine honour!  All that remains for me
to do now is to collect the half-dozen masks which I swore
awhile ago to place as a trophy at your feet.'
</p>

<p>
'I forbid you, Messire,' she retorted coldly, 'to pursue
this callous jest any further.'
</p>

<p>
'Jest?  It was no jest, Madame!  I swore to unmask
these gentlemen, and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And took good care to protect yourself against their
wrath by a crowd of ruffianly bullies!  The victory&mdash;if,
indeed, there be one&mdash;doth not redound to the credit of
Messire le Prince de Froidmont.'
</p>

<p>
'Even so, I must redeem my pledge,' he riposted in a tone
quite as cool now as hers.  'So, by your leave&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
She watched him, fascinated&mdash;somewhat like a hare
might watch the playful antics of a tiger&mdash;with blue eyes
opened wide in wonder and horror, as he went lightly from
one man to the other and with deft fingers removed their
masks, then threaded them by the eye-slits along the length
of his sword.  De Borel never moved&mdash;he was quite
unconscious, and La Broye only groaned and tried to turn
away.  But both Herlaer and du Prêt struggled in feeble
self-defence, and Maarege, still clutching his broken rapier,
made futile efforts to lunge at Gilles.  But they too were
faint from exhaustion and loss of blood, and Gilles, who
had himself well in hand, had strength enough for his
self-imposed task.  Jacqueline never moved.  Protests against
this outrage were obviously of no avail, and physically she
had not the strength to intervene.  But when he finally
turned to de Landas, she interposed with all her might,
with the motherly instinct of a bird, striving to protect
its mate.
</p>

<p>
'I forbid you, Messire!' she cried.
</p>

<p>
But even before the words were out of her mouth, de
Landas with a hoarse cry of pent-up rage had struggled
to his feet.  With convulsed hands he fell heavily on Gilles,
gripping him by the throat.  Jacqueline could not suppress
the cry of horror which rose to her lips: these two wounded
men, one of them in the last stages of exhaustion, fighting
and tearing, at grips with one another, like beasts convulsed
in a desperate struggle for life.
</p>

<p>
But that same struggle could not help but be brief.  De
Landas was vanquished even before his last futile effort
had fully matured.  A minute or two later he was on his
knees.  Gilles held him down with one hand and with the
other detached the mask from his face.  He had thrown
down his sword when de Landas attacked him with his
hands.  The row of masks had slid down the blade; they
now lay in a mass upon the matting, right at Jacqueline's
feet.  De Landas' mask went to join the rest, and Gilles
coolly picked up his sword.  The light from the torch was
full on him.  Jacqueline still watched him, speechless and
fascinated.  It seemed as if she could not detach her eyes
from him&mdash;his masked face, his broad shoulders, his hands;
above all, his hands&mdash;the left one wherewith he tossed de
Landas' mask at her feet; and the right, which clutched
that exquisitely fashioned rapier with so much conscious
power.
</p>

<p>
In a vague, dreamy kind of way, she noted how slender
and nervy were those hands, despite their outward roughness
and toil-worn look&mdash;the hands of a soldier, very obviously.
The Prince de Froidmont must have been in many a bloody
fray; had been wounded too on the left wrist&mdash;a severe
cut.  The scar gleamed white against the bronzed hue of
the flesh.  Jacqueline gazed on, strangely stirred.  The
scar was a very peculiar one, shaped like a cross, and at
the time must almost have severed the wrist from the arm.
She only remembered having once seen a similar wound,
which must have left just such a peculiar scar.  That was
some three years ago, after that awful fight near Gembloux.
Her brother Jan, since dead, was at the time lying sick at
the monastery close by.  She had wandered out for a breath
of fresh air, feeling weary and desperately anxious.  She
was a mere child then, just past her sixteenth year.
Outside the postern gate she and Nicolle had espied a soldier,
lying wounded and unconscious on the ground.  Nicolle
had gone for help and two of the good monks had carried
the poor man into the monastery.  The leech who waited
on Jan had tended him, and afterwards Jacqueline had
ordered him to be transported back on the abandoned
battle-field, where mayhap his comrades would presently
find him; and she had seen that he was provided with food
and with a pitcher of water, for she had been so sorry&mdash;so
very sorry for him.
</p>

<p>
All that had happened three years ago, and Jacqueline
had never thought on the matter again until now.  Strange
that the scar on Messire le Prince de Froidmont's wrist
should so remind her of that little incident which had occurred
in the monastery near Gembloux.  Strange also that Messire
should stand before her now and be searching her face with
that intent glance of his, which she could feel right through
the slits of his mask.  He caught her looking at him so
inquiringly and she straightway averted her gaze; but
not before she had noted that with a quick gesture he had
suddenly pulled the sleeve of his doublet well over his
hand.
</p>

<p>
Gilles abruptly made for the door.  But close to the
threshold he turned and looked once more on Jacqueline.
He could no longer see her face now, for she was stooping
to de Landas, supporting him with her strong young arms.
She had given one glance at the half-dozen masks which
lay there on the floor where he had thrown them down.
One or two were stained, others torn.  She gave a shudder
of horror and buried her face on de Landas' shoulder!
Gilles could see that at sight of those things she had at last
given way to tears and that convulsive sobs were shaking
her lovely shoulders.
</p>

<p>
He felt a miserable brute&mdash;a callous ruffian who, for the
sake of despicable vainglory, had done just the last thing
that broke down this valiant woman's magnificent fortitude.
A wave of self-contempt swept over him.  He had
meant to justify himself, to tell her that, far from being a
common braggart who employed paid spadassins to save
his own skin, he and his one faithful henchman had been
set upon by her lover and his friends aided by half a dozen
varlets to boot.  He had meant to challenge de Landas to
deny this truth, to force an avowal from his lips or from
those of the young coxcombs who had played such a cowardly
rôle in this night's work.
</p>

<p>
Yes, he had meant her to know the truth&mdash;the truth which
would have shown her her lover and her friends in their
true light.  But when he saw those exquisite shoulders
shaken with sobs, when he heard the pitiful little moans
which at last found their way to her lips, he felt that he
could not add yet another sorrow to the heavy burden
which was weighing that golden head down.  Now he was
something of a knave in her sight; if she learned the truth
from his lips he would become a cur in his own.
</p>

<p>
And, bidding Jehan to follow him, Gilles de Crohin
hurried out of the room.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
HOW TWO LETTERS CAME TO BE WRITTEN
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p class="quote">
'Madam la Reyne,' wrote Gilles the self-same night
ere he laid down to rest, 'I entreat you to seek out
Monseigneur le duc d'Anjou at once.  Matters have occurred
which might endanger the whole Success of this Enterprise.
Madame Jacqueline is beautiful, exquisite, the most perfect
Woman that ever graced a princely husband's house.  So let
Monseigneur come at once, Madame la Reyne, at once, I beg
of you most humbly! and do entreat you to send me word by
Maître Jehan when I may expect him.
</p>

<p class="quote">
  'I am, your Majesty's<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Most Obedient and Most Faithful Servant,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Gilles de Crohin.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He felt more calm, more at peace with himself when he
had written this letter, and allowed Jehan now to undress
him and to attend to his wounds.  They were not serious,
certainly not so serious as many others which he had
sustained in the past and recovered from without much trouble.
But, somehow, this time he felt in a fever, the paltry scratches
seemed unaccountably to throb, and his temples ached nigh
to splitting.
</p>

<p>
Jehan, stolid and disapproving, pulled off his master's
boots, took off doublet and hose with care and dexterity,
but without making any attempt at conversation.  What
went on behind his low, square forehead could easily be
conjectured: a towering rage against his own halting speech,
which had prevented his proclaiming the truth before
Madame Jacqueline, warred with a certain vague terror
that Messire was angered with him for having brought
Madame upon the scene.
</p>

<p>
But Messire apparently was too tired to scold.  With
unusual meekness he allowed Jehan to wash and dress that
cut he had in the shoulder, and the one which had penetrated
the fleshy part of his thigh.  Maître Jehan was skilful
in such matters.  His father had been an apothecary
at Grenoble and had taught the youngster something of the
art of drugs and simples, until the latter's roving disposition
had driven him to seeking fortune abroad.  He still knew,
however, how to minister to a wounded man, how to stem
the flow of blood, and apply healing bandages.  All this he
did now in silence, and with the loving care engendered by
his passionate affection for the master whom he served, the
friend to whom he owed his life.
</p>

<p>
And all the while Gilles lay quite quiescent, so passive
and patient that Jehan felt he must be very sick.  Anger,
self-contempt, self-reproach, had brought a heavy frown
between his brows.  Jacqueline's adorable image gave him
a heart-ache more difficult to bear than any physical pain.
For a long while he kept his eyes resolutely closed, in order
to shut out the vision of a golden head and a demure,
tantalizing face, which seemed to mock at him from out the
dark angle of the room.  It was only when Jehan had finished
his ministrations and in his turn was ready to go to bed
that he woke once more to the realities of life.
</p>

<p>
'Thou art a good soul, Jehan,' he murmured, with the
first return to well-being brought about by the good fellow's
restoratives.
</p>

<p>
'And you a mightily foolish one!' thought Jehan within
himself, while he merely stuttered a moody: 'Aye&mdash;aye!'
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow morning,' continued Gilles; 'or rather, this
morning&mdash;for 'tis past midnight now&mdash;thou'lt start for La
Fère&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'F-f-f-for La F-f-f&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'For La Fère.  Thou'lt take thy safe-conduct and this
letter which I have just written for Madame la Reyne de
Navarre.'
</p>

<p>
'B-b-b-but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Hold thy tongue till I have finished.  If Madame la
Reyne hath perchance left La Fère, thou'lt follow her
whithersoever she may have gone.'
</p>

<p>
'And if-f-f-f&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'There is no "if" about the matter, my good Jehan,'
quoth Gilles with a sigh and in a tone of unwonted firmness.
'Thou must find Madame la Reyne, and if she be not in
La Fère then thou must follow her to Paris, or to Pau,
or to the outermost ends of the earth; for Madame la Reyne
must have my letter as soon as ever possible or the
consequences for her, for me, for us all would be disastrous.'
</p>

<p>
Jehan made no further attempt at conversation.  He
only nodded his head in obedience and understanding.
</p>

<p>
'Madame la Reyne,' continued Gilles after a moment's
pause, 'will, I doubt not, send me a letter in reply.  I
need not tell thee, Jehan, to guard both my letter and her
reply with thy life.'
</p>

<p>
'N-n-no!' said Jehan with sudden glibness.  'You
n-n-need not t-t-tell me that.'
</p>

<p>
'The letter would give us all away if it fell in alien hands.
It must be destroyed, and thou too, honest Jehan, ere it
leave thy hands.'
</p>

<p>
Jehan made a sign of comprehension, which Gilles
evidently understood, for he continued more easily:
</p>

<p>
'Then get some rest now, Jehan, for thou must start as
soon after daybreak as possible.  And in God's name,' he
added with a weary sigh, 'return with the answer within the
week, or maybe thou'lt find my body rotting upon the
gallows somewhere in the town.'
</p>

<p>
Jehan shrugged his wide shoulders.  This meant that he
thought his master must be slightly delirious, else he would
never have spoken such rubbish.  He took the letter which
Gilles had folded into as small a compass as possible, and
slipped it underneath his doublet and his shirt, against his
skin.  Then he tapped his breast and looked reassuringly
on his master.  Gesture and look conveyed all that he
desired, and Gilles was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
He knew that he could trust Jehan as he would himself.
With a final sigh which was almost one of content, he turned
over on his side and went to sleep.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
But faithful Jehan le Bègue did not go to sleep that
night.  Not until the late hours of the morning did he do
that, and by then he was half a league away out of Cambray.
As soon as he had seen his master lying in comparative
comfort, he picked up the guttering candle and, walking
cautiously on the tips of his toes, he went downstairs.
Immediately under the stairs there was a narrow cupboard,
and here upon the bare boards, rolled up In a blanket,
Maître Julien was wont to sleep&mdash;of late with one eye open
and one ear ready prepared to catch the slightest sound,
since his liege-lady, the exquisite Queen of Navarre, had
constituted him the guardian of Monseigneur le Prince de
Froidmont.
</p>

<p>
Even now, at the first sound of those cautious footsteps,
Julien was awake, and when, a minute or two later, Jehan
peered into the narrow cupboard, he met the youth's eyes
staring at him, glowing with that look of alertness and
wariness which is peculiar to small animals at bay.  He
had raised himself on his elbow, but Jehan could see that
underneath the ragged coverlet Julien's hand was grasping
a pistol.
</p>

<p>
'F-f-f-friend,' he stuttered in a gruff whisper, 'g-g-get
up.  M-m-monseigneur's service,' he added significantly.
</p>

<p>
In a trice Julien was up.
</p>

<p>
'What is it?'
</p>

<p>
Jehan made several animated gestures, indicative of
writing.
</p>

<p>
'Follow me,' rejoined Julien briefly.
</p>

<p>
He took the candle from Jehan and together the two men
went into the room opposite, which served as taproom for
the few guests who honoured 'Les Trois Rois' with their
custom.
</p>

<p>
There was a long, narrow table at one end of the room.
On this Julien placed the candle; then from a small cupboard
in the wall he took paper, pen, sand and inkhorn, and
placed these also upon the table.
</p>

<p>
There ensued then a long, whispered consultation between
these two men.  Julien with infinite patience gradually drew
from Maître Jehan, bit by bit, almost word for word what
he required.  Ah! if Maître Jehan could only have put his
wishes down on paper, matters would have been quite
easy; but calligraphy was one of the arts which that worthy
had never mastered in his youth, and which he certainly
had not practised for the past twenty years.  But what
knowledge could not accomplish, that a boundless devotion
on both sides contrived to do this night.  Perspiration stood
out in great beads upon Jehan's forehead, there was a deep
frown of perplexity upon his brow as he stammered out
laborious instructions to Julien.  There was a strong vein
of dogged obstinacy in his composition and a certain sound
was still ringing in his ear, which spurred him to desperate
efforts to make himself understood.  It was the sound of
Messire's weird laugh&mdash;harsh and uncontrolled&mdash;when
Madame had taunted him with having a number of paid
ruffians round him to help him in the fight against all those
noble assassins.  Paid ruffians, forsooth!  Madame should
know the truth, even if Maître Jehan's brain gave way under
the terrible strain of making that cheesy-faced Julien
understand what he wanted.
</p>

<p>
And Julien, intent, ghastly pale in his eagerness, listened
with ear and mind and eyes and every sense strained to
breaking point, to find sense and coherence in Jehan's
stammering.  For two hours these two men sat face to
face with the guttering candle between them, glaring into
one another's face, as if each would tear out the other's
innermost brain and knead it to his will.
</p>

<p>
But at last Julien understood.  By dint of broken
monosyllables and emphatic gestures, Jehan had made it clear
to him what had happened, and Julien, suddenly motioning
the other to be silent, was at last able to put pen to
paper.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
'Most noble and gracious Seigneur,' he wrote, 'the writer
is only a poor servant and you are a great and Puissant Lord;
but I will tell you the Truth about what happened this night.
Messire was set upon by six Noblemen, and the Writer
was set upon by six Knaves.  Messire was taken unawares and
so was I.  I feigned dead dog because I wanted to go and
fetch help.  Then the knaves were called away to help in the
Murder of Messire, and I went to call Madame.  Twelve
against two, Monseigneur!  Was that right?  And Messire
fought them all single-handed.  This is the truth so help me
God and I am Monseigneur's
</p>

<p class="quote">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Most humble and obedient Servant,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Jehan: servant to Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When Julien had finished writing the letter he read it
through aloud to Jehan three times; then, when the latter
expressed himself completely satisfied with it, he folded it
and Jehan slipped it inside his doublet, beside the one which
Messire had given him.
</p>

<p>
After which, he took up the candle again and bade Maître
Julien 'good-night.'  He did not thank Julien, because he
knew quite well that what the latter had done had given
him infinite happiness to do.  Every gesture, every look
in the young man's face had proclaimed that happiness.
In serving Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont, he had
indirectly served the goddess whom he worshipped from
afar.  His pale face still irradiated with joy, he went back
to his poor, hard bed, to dream that She was smiling on
him for his devotion to Her wishes.
</p>

<p>
And Jehan went straightway to his master's room.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
The pale rays of a wintry moon came creeping in through
the narrow casement-window.  A lovely night had succeeded
the drenching rain of awhile ago.  Messire lay quite still
upon his bed, but when Jehan crept close up to him he saw
that his eyes were wide open.
</p>

<p>
'What's the matter, Jehan?' Gilles asked, when he
saw his faithful henchman standing before him, booted
and fully dressed.
</p>

<p>
'I can't sl-sl-sl-sleep,' replied Jehan unblushingly, 's-s-so
I'll g-g-g-go now.'
</p>

<p>
'At once?'
</p>

<p>
Jehan nodded.
</p>

<p>
'Can you get your horse at this hour?'
</p>

<p>
Jehan nodded again.
</p>

<p>
'You have your safe-conduct?&mdash;the letter?'
</p>

<p>
More vigorous nods from Jehan.
</p>

<p>
'Take what money you want from there.'  And Gilles
with a jerk of the head indicated the valise which contained
his effects.
</p>

<p>
Jehan knelt on the floor beside the valise and turned
over his master's belongings.  He took a small purse
containing some gold, which he slipped into the pocket of his
breeches; then he selected a fresh doublet, hose and mantle
for Messire to wear and carefully folded and put away the
tattered garments which had suffered so much damage
during the fight.  Oh!  Maître Jehan was a tidy valet when
he gave his mind to such trivial matters, and just now his
mind was sorely exercised over Messire's future plight when
he would be deprived of the services of so efficient a henchman.
</p>

<p>
Messire watched all his doings with much amusement.
</p>

<p>
''Tis not the first time that I shall be servantless, my
good man,' he said lightly.  'And of a truth I have been
too much pampered in that way of late.  I still know how
to dress myself and how to clean my boots&mdash;Aye!' he added,
catching Jehan's look of reproach, 'and how to tend to
these silly scratches which the very unskilful blades of
M. de Landas and his friends did inflict upon my body.'
</p>

<p>
With a gesture of genuine affection he put out his hand,
and good old Jehan took it in both his rough brown ones.
When Gilles withdrew his hand again he noticed that
there was a warm, wet spot upon it, whilst Jehan turned
away very quickly, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his
doublet.
</p>

<p>
But not another word was spoken by either of these two
men&mdash;master and servant, friends and comrades&mdash;who
understood one another to the last secret thought and the
innermost heartbeat.
</p>

<p>
A moment or two later, Jehan had blown out the candle
and was gone, and Gilles, lying on the narrow paillasse,
wide awake, listened while he could hear his faithful
servant's heavy footstep stumping along the corridor and
down the stairs.
</p>

<p>
The wintry moon shed a weird, cold light into the narrow
room, upon his valise, the elegant doublet which Jehan
had so carefully laid out, the bottle of sedative, the fresh
bandages, the pots of salve laid close to his hands.  A heavy
sigh rose involuntarily to his lips.  Life appeared very
difficult and very complicated just then.  It had been so
extraordinarily simple before: fighting for the most part,
starving often, no cares, no worries, no thought for the
morrow; then the axe finally laid to the root of life,
somewhere on a battlefield, when Destiny had worked her will
with the soldier of fortune.
</p>

<p>
But now&mdash;&mdash;!  And there was faithful Jehan, dragged
too, and innocently, into this adventure, involved in an
episode which might find the gallows for its conclusion.
Gilles, listening, could hear his henchman's raucous stutter,
rousing the echoes of the squalid little hostelry.  Anon
there was much scuffling and shuffling, doors opening and
shutting, calls from Jehan and calls from Julien; then for
awhile only distant and confused sounds of people stirring.
Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour later the tramp of a
horse's hoofs upon the cobblestones, more calls and some
shouting, a good deal of clatter, the final banging of a heavy
door&mdash;then nothing more.
</p>

<p>
And Gilles turned over, trying to get to sleep.  In his
hand he held, tightly clutched, a small, white, sweet-scented
rag&mdash;a tiny ball of damp cambric; and ever and anon he
raised that ball to his lips ... or to his eyes.  But he
could not get to sleep.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
HOW MADAME JACQUELINE WAS GRAVELY PUZZLED
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Old Nicolle and the women had known how to hold
their tongues, so had Madame Jacqueline's torch-bearer.
Indiscretion these days, where the affairs of noble
gentlemen were concerned, was apt to bring terrible reprisals
in its train.  And above all, M. le Marquis de Landas was
not a gentleman to be trifled with.  If he desired secrecy,
secrecy he would have, and woe betide the unfortunates
who had not known how to hold their tongue.
</p>

<p>
Nicolle, aided by Maria and Bertine&mdash;two of Madame's
most trustworthy serving-maids&mdash;had done their best to
tend the wounds of the noble seigneurs, while the torch-bearer
was despatched to their respective houses to summon
immediate assistance.  Messire de Borel was wealthy,
owned horses and had an army of servants; the Comte
du Prêt lived in a fine palace on the Place Verte, and the
Seigneur de Maarege in the Rue St. George.
</p>

<p>
It was all done very quickly and very discreetly.
Monseigneur the governor was never meant to know what
had occurred in his Palace that night; servants came
and went on tiptoe; the night watchmen had anyhow been
bribed to secrecy.  Martin et Martine at the Town Hall
had only chimed the second hour of the morning and already
the six young gallants had been conveyed back to their
homes; the boudoir was locked up and the key given in
charge of the night watchmen, who would see that order
there was once more restored.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline never deserted her self-appointed post until
she was satisfied that the last vestige of that awful scuffle
had been effectually obliterated.  She helped Nicolle and
her women to dress the wounds of the young seigneurs;
she remained by de Landas' side until she saw him safely
in the stalwart arms of his own henchmen.  It was amazing
how a girl, so young and so inexperienced, was able to give
directions and to keep her head through this amazingly
trying time.  She had broken down once, when Gilles had
thrown the masks at her feet; but directly he had gone
she recovered herself, and from that moment everything
was done at her command.  Nicolle and the women, who
were on the verge of losing their heads&mdash;of screaming and
falling into a panic, were soon restored to order and efficiency
by Madame's coolness and by her courage.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline never flinched, nor did she ask any questions.
She was affectionate with de Landas and gentle to all, but
evidently her one care was to keep this miserable affair
a secret from her guardian.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
On the other hand, I, for one, am not going to say that
Gilles de Crohin was not a sick man on the following
morning, when he managed to crawl out of bed and to
dress himself, inwardly cursing the absence of his faithful
Jehan.  He made light of 'scratches,' but he had no fewer
than five about his body, and the flesh wound in his thigh
was exceedingly unpleasant.  He had sat moodily in his
narrow room for some time, vaguely wondering what in
the world he was to do with himself, or whether Madame
Jacqueline would ever care to set eyes on him again.
</p>

<p>
He was smarting under the sense of injustice.  What
right had she to look on him as a braggart who would pay
a set of knaves to help him in his quarrels?  The feeling
of insensate jealousy which was gnawing at his heart was
still more unpleasant to bear.  He almost understood de
Landas' hatred of himself after the episode in the banqueting
hall, for he&mdash;Gilles&mdash;was at this moment experiencing
just that same torturing jealousy, which had caused de
Landas to outrage every canon of chivalry and honour
for the sake of getting even with an execrated rival.
</p>

<p>
In fact, neither his mental nor his physical condition
was in an enviable state when a runner arrived that morning
at 'Les Trois Rois' and asked for leave to speak with Messire
Gilles de Crohin, equerry to Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont.
</p>

<p>
Gilles, a little bewildered by this unexpected occurrence,
met the runner in the taproom of the hostelry.  Somewhat
curtly, he told the man that Monseigneur le Prince was
sick, and that he&mdash;Gilles&mdash;was in attendance on his master.
But the messenger appeared in no way disconcerted at the
rebuff; he seemed to have received instructions that would
cover every eventuality.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur the governor,' he said, 'had heard a
rumour that His Magnificence was sick.  Therefore he
begged that Messire de Crohin would forthwith come over
to the Palace and reassure him as to the condition of his
master, Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont.'
</p>

<p>
The runner had long disappeared down the Rue aux
Juifs and Gilles de Crohin was still standing in the middle
of the taproom, clutching his chin with his hand in a state
of most unenviable perturbation.  A very severe test on
his histrionic powers was about to be imposed upon him.
Monseigneur's desire&mdash;nay! his command&mdash;could not be
disregarded.  He&mdash;Gilles&mdash;must present himself at the
Palace just as he was&mdash;playing no rôle this time, save that
of striving to obliterate all similarity between himself as
he really was and would be to-day, and himself as he had
been in Monseigneur's sight during the past five days.
</p>

<p>
No wonder that at the prospect he too&mdash;like Jehan last
night&mdash;felt cold drops of sweat rising to the roots of his
hair.  I will not say that the thought of seeing Madame
Jacqueline again, if he went to the Palace, did not in a
measure give him courage; but even that courage was
only fictitious, because in all probability she would scarce
vouchsafe to look on the servant, seeing that her heart
was filled with hatred and contempt for the master.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, he was at the Palace less than an hour
later.  Monseigneur was very gracious, and apparently
not the least suspicious.  He only expressed regret that
it had not been his good fortune to meet Messire Gilles de
Crohin ere this.  On the other hand, his apologies for
what had occurred the night before inside his own Palace
were both profuse and humble&mdash;almost abject.
</p>

<p>
'I beg you, Messire,' he said earnestly, at the close of
the interview, 'to assure Monseigneur le Duc d'Anjou
that I would give ten years of my life&mdash;and I have not
many left to give&mdash;to undo the mischief wrought by a few
young nincompoops.  I can but hope that His Highness
will exonerate me from any negligence or want of
understanding in the matter.'
</p>

<p>
By this time Gilles was mentally quite at his ease.  If
his thigh was painful, he had nevertheless managed to
walk into Monseigneur's presence without a limp, and to
all appearances his host was at this hour very far from
suspecting the slightest fraud.
</p>

<p>
'His Highness,' he said lightly, 'will recover from his
scratches within the next day or two.  The whole matter
is unworthy of Monseigneur's anxiety.'
</p>

<p>
After which assurance, and mutual protestations of
esteem and good-will, Gilles was allowed to take his leave.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Being a personage of no consequence, Messire Gilles de
Crohin, equerry to Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont,
was not escorted to the gates by an army of ushers; rather
was he allowed to find his way out as best he could.  The
interview with Monseigneur had taken place in a room on
a floor above, and he was walking slowly along one of the
wide corridors which, if memory served him, would lead
him to the grand staircase.  On his right the tall,
deep-embrasured windows gave on the magnificent park which,
with its stately trees still dressed in winter garb, lay bathed
in the sunlight of this early spring day.
</p>

<p>
He paused just for a moment, looking over the park at
the rich panorama of the city.  The window nearest to
him was slightly open, and the south-westerly breeze was
apparently stirring the heavy curtains in front of it.  From
somewhere close by there came gently wafted the delicious
penetrating fragrance of lilies.  Was it a wonder that
Gilles' thoughts should at once have flown to Jacqueline? and
that an uncontrollable ache should suddenly grip his
heart?
</p>

<p>
Throughout his long adventurous life he had seen so many
women&mdash;had kissed a few, and loved none; and now Fate
had placed in his path just the one woman in the whole
wide world whom at first sight he had loved with unbounded
passion, and who was as far removed from him as was the
gold-crowned steeple of St. Géry far away, and infinitely
more unattainable.  For the first time in his life Gilles
had looked into a woman's eyes, felt that they held in their
depths a promise of paradise, only to realize that that
promise could never be made to him.
</p>

<p>
The scent of the lilies brought with it a murmur of spring,
of awakening nature, of twitter of birds, and the man who
listened to that murmur, who thrilled at its insistent call,
knew that he must for ever remain lonely, that the call of
springtide for him must for ever remain unsatisfied.
</p>

<p>
Standing there alone, he was not ashamed of his emotion,
not ashamed that hot tears welled up involuntarily to his
eyes.  But with a half-impatient gesture and a smile at
his own folly, he brushed these with his hand resolutely
away.
</p>

<p>
When the mist of tears was cleared from his eyes, he
suddenly saw her&mdash;his dream&mdash;standing before him.  She
was in the window embrasure, with the flood of sunshine
wrapping her like a mantle of gold.  On the window sill
beside her lay a bunch of white lilies.  Her little
hand&mdash;Gilles thought he had never seen such an exquisite little
hand&mdash;held back the curtain, behind which she had apparently
been sitting.  A soft breeze blew in through the half-open
window and stirred with its delicate breath the soft
tendrils of her ardent hair.  Her face against the light was
in a tender, grey shadow, through which her eyes shone
like a peep of azure sky, and on her cheek that tiny mole
was provocatively asking for a kiss.
</p>

<p>
The apparition had come upon Gilles so suddenly, the
transition from dark melancholy to joy was so abrupt,
that he&mdash;poor man!&mdash;weak, sick, unnerved by weariness
and constant strain, not only found nothing to say, but
he clean forgot all the amenities of social life which the
equerry of a prince of the House of Valois should have had
at his finger-tips.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline, too, strangely enough, felt embarrassed for
the moment, angry with herself for being tongue-tied.
What was there to be confused about?  Messire Gilles de
Crohin could not possibly guess that she had been sitting
here in the window embrasure, waiting to see him pass,
just because she desired to have news of his master.  He
could not guess that it had taken all her reserves of diplomacy
to so explain to Monseigneur when he questioned her, what
she knew of the events of the past night that, without
being greatly angered against M. de Landas, he should
feel sufficient compunction to send promptly for news of
Messire le Prince de Froidmont.  Certainly Messire's
equerry could not guess that Madame Jacqueline's heart
had been touched and her mind tickled when Monseigneur
placed before her the naïve effusion of Maître Jehan, and
that her own common sense and unerring feeling for justice
had filled in the gaps which the worthy servant's missive
had left in his exposé of what had actually occurred.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it was not the fear of what Messire de Crohin
might think or guess that kept Jacqueline momentarily
speechless and shy, rather was it a curious and undefinable
sense of something strange&mdash;familiar yet mysterious&mdash;about
the personality of this man who stood, equally silent,
before her.  It took her several seconds to free herself
from this spell which appeared to have been cast over
her, several seconds of fighting angrily with herself for
the constraint which rendered her tongue-tied and shy.
Fortunately he appeared quite unaware of her embarrassment,
waited somewhat awkwardly, she thought, for her
to speak.
</p>

<p>
'You are Messire de Crohin?' she contrived to say at
last.
</p>

<p>
'At your service, Madame,' he replied.
</p>

<p>
'Equerry to Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont?'
</p>

<p>
He bowed in affirmative response.
</p>

<p>
'And ... I have no doubt ... devoted to his person?'
</p>

<p>
He smiled.
</p>

<p>
'Why should Madame conclude that?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
She gave a little start.  Somehow his tone&mdash;that bantering
smile, had accentuated that feeling of familiarity which
rendered his person so strangely mysterious.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont,' she rejoined coldly,
'is sure to command the devotion of those who serve him.
He is brave and chivalrous&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That was not Madame's opinion of him last night&mdash;&mdash;'
he broke in dryly.  Then, seeing that his tone had caused
her to turn her eyes on him with unfeigned surprise he
added somewhat lamely: 'At least ... that is ... that
is what Monseigneur gave me to understand last night&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'It was all a misunderstanding,' she said gently.  'Will
you say that to Monseigneur?'
</p>

<p>
'If Madame desires.'
</p>

<p>
'I do desire it.  And since you know all about the
incident, Messire, will you, I pray you, tell your master how
deeply I regret the erroneous judgment which I formed
of his conduct?  Those abominable varlets all crowding
round him&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Appearances were against Monseigneur, no doubt.'
</p>

<p>
'And I behaved like a vixen, Messire,' she said with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
'Then give me an army of vixens!' he retorted
impulsively.
</p>

<p>
'Why, Messire, you were not there to see&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'No!  But I imagine now that vixens must be adorable.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not jest, Messire,' she rejoined more earnestly.  'I
was shrewish last night and ill-tempered and unjust.  Will
you tell your master that this morning&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I will tell him, Madame, that this morning you are
perfect, whatever you may have been last night.'
</p>

<p>
Poor Gilles by now would have given all that he possessed
in the world to be allowed to go.  He felt that this interview,
which he had neither sought nor hoped for, was like a
dangerous trap into which Fate and his own temperament
might hurl him headlong.  Every minute that he spent
in this woman's company rendered her more desirable to
him, rendered him more completely a slave to her charm.
But for some strange and subtle reason she seemed disinclined
to let him go just yet, and even now when, remembering
his best manners, Gilles started on the preliminaries
of a most elaborate farewell bow, she went on with a quick
catching of her breath and a slight hesitation, which brought
a soft glow to her cheeks:
</p>

<p>
'Messire Gilles&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'At your service, Madame.'
</p>

<p>
'Was Monseigneur de Froidmont very angered with me?'
</p>

<p>
'He was,' Gilles admitted, 'last night.'
</p>

<p>
"But ... but....'
</p>

<p>
'His anger hath since melted like snow in the spring.'
</p>

<p>
'Even before you came hither at the bidding of my
guardian?'
</p>

<p>
'Even before that, Madame.'
</p>

<p>
'Did he tell you so?'
</p>

<p>
'I guessed it.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you know his innermost thoughts, then?'
</p>

<p>
'Most of them&mdash;yes, Madame.'
</p>

<p>
'You are very intimate with Monseigneur le Prince de
Froidmont?' she asked, with a certain shy hesitancy
which Gilles found adorable, because it caused a delicate
flush of pink to suffuse her cheeks.  This caused him, in
his turn, to be confused and tongue-tied, staring at her
with eyes that seemed as if they would devour her
loveliness.
</p>

<p>
She had to repeat her question.
</p>

<p>
'Oh!&mdash;ah!&mdash;er!' he stammered vaguely.  'That is&mdash;yes!
Yes, Madame!  I am on ultimate terms with Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'And&mdash;do tell me, Messire&mdash;is Monseigneur handsome?'
</p>

<p>
'No, by the Lord!' exclaimed Gilles with a loud laugh.
Then he caught her look: it was not one of surprise,
rather of amusement not unmixed with quaint, roguish
mischief.  He could not interpret that look rightly, and
began to stammer, worse confused than before.
</p>

<p>
'Madame&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You are no judge of your master's looks, shall we say?'
she retorted with an enigmatic little smile.  'But you must
remember that, though I found Monseigneur of noble bearing,
I have no notion how he looks, for I have never seen him
without a mask&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
This time Gilles was quite sure that she was doing her
best to suppress a laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Do you think,' she said, 'that you could persuade His
Magnificence to pay his respects to me unmasked?'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur will, I feel sure,' he rejoined stiffly, 'be
honoured by the command, but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But what, Messire?'
</p>

<p>
'He is strangely ill-favoured, Madame.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! a woman is the best judge of that.  Some of the
ugliest men have proved most attractive.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;but Monseigneur is scarred&mdash;badly scarred.  He&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What matter?  There is naught so glorious as scars
on a soldier's face.  When I was a child I once saw the Duc
de Guise&mdash;le Balafré!  With that great cut across his
cheek, he was still the most notable man in a room filled
to overflowing with clever, brave and handsome men!'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;but, Madame, Monseigneur is also pock-marked.
Yes, that's it!  Pock-marked!  An illness contracted in
early childhood&mdash;Madame understands?'
</p>

<p>
'I do,' she replied with a little sigh of sympathy, and
looked with those enchanting blue eyes of hers straight on
poor Gilles.  'I do.  It is very sad.'
</p>

<p>
'Very sad indeed, Madame.'
</p>

<p>
'Scarred and pock-marked.  No wonder Monseigneur
is shy to show his face.  But no matter,' she continued
gaily.  'He hath such a lovely voice, and oh! such beautiful
hands!  Slender and full of nerve and power!  I always
take note of hands, Messire,' she said with well-feigned
ingenuousness.  'They indicate a man's character almost
more than his face.  Do you not think, so too?'
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;Madame&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Gilles had, quite instinctively, drawn the lace of his
sleeve over his left hand, even while Madame still looked
at him with that tantalizing glance which had the effect
of turning his brain to putty and his knees to pulp.  Now
she laughed&mdash;that merry, rippling laugh of hers&mdash;and I
do verily assure you that the poor man was on the verge
of making a complete fool of himself.  Indeed, it were
difficult to say whether or no the next second would have
witnessed his complete surrender to Jacqueline's magic
charm, his total loss of self-control and the complete
downfall of Madame la Reyne de Navarre's cherished plan, for
poor Gilles had lost consciousness of every other feeling
and thought save that of a wild longing to fall on his knees
and to kiss the tiny foot which peeped beneath the hem of
that exquisite woman's gown, a wild longing, too, to hold
out his arms and to fold her to his breast, to kiss her hair,
her eyes, her lips, that tiny mole which had wrought the
whole mischief with his soul.  For the moment he forgot
his past life, his present position, the Duc d'Anjou and
Madame la Reyne: he had forgotten that he was a penniless
adventurer, paid to play an unworthy trick upon this
innocent girl, sworn to infamy on pain of greater infamy still!
He had forgotten everything save that she was adorable
and that an altogether new and ardent love had taken
possession of his soul.
</p>

<p>
Of a truth it is impossible for a prosy chronicler to state
definitely what might have happened then, if Monseigneur
the governor had not chosen that very moment for coming
out of his room and walking down the corridor, at one
end of which Gilles was standing spell-bound before the
living presentment of his dream of long ago.  He heard
Monseigneur's heavy footstep, pulled himself vigorously
together, and with an impatient gesture which was habitual
to him, he passed his left hand slowly across his forehead.
</p>

<p>
When he looked on Jacqueline again she was staring at
him with an expression that appeared almost scared and
wholly bewildered, and with a strange, puzzled frown upon
her smooth forehead.  For the space of a second or two it
seemed as if she wanted to say something, then held back
the words.  After a slight hesitation, however, she finally
went forward a step or two to meet her guardian, without
looking again on Gilles.
</p>

<p>
'I was glad,' she said quietly to d'Inchy, 'to have had
an opportunity of seeing Messire de Crohin and of begging
him to offer to Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont, his
master, my sincere regrets for what occurred last night.'
</p>

<p>
'Messire has already assured me,' rejoined d'Inchy suavely,
'that Monseigneur harbours no resentment against any of
us.  Is that not so, Messire?'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed it is, Monseigneur,' replied Gilles stiffly.  'Whatever
Monseigneur may have felt last night, I in his name
do assure you that at this hour the incident of last night
hath faded from his memory.'
</p>

<p>
He bowed now, ready to take his leave.  But Jacqueline
was apparently not yet ready to dismiss him.  Something
had gravely puzzled her, that was clear; and it was that
something which seemingly made her loth to let him go.
</p>

<p>
'What, think you, Messire,' she said abruptly, 'caused
Monseigneur to forget his resentment so quickly?'
</p>

<p>
'A journey, Madame,' he replied, looking her boldly
between the eyes this time, 'which his thoughts took
skywards, astride upon a sunbeam.'
</p>

<p>
She smiled.
</p>

<p>
'And did Monseigneur's thoughts wander far on that
perilous journey?'
</p>

<p>
'As far as the unknown, Madame.'
</p>

<p>
'The unknown?  Where is that?'
</p>

<p>
'There where we sow our dreams.'
</p>

<p>
'Where we sow our dreams?  You speak in metaphors,
Messire.  If, as you say, we sow our dreams, what do we
reap?'
</p>

<p>
'A perfect being such as you, Madame, can only reap
joy and happiness.'
</p>

<p>
'But you, Messire?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I, Madame!' he replied with a shrug of his broad
shoulders.  'What can a poor soldier of fortune garner
from a crop of dreams save a bunch of memories?'
</p>

<p>
'Happy memories, I trust,' she said gently, as she finally
extended her dainty hand for his kiss.
</p>

<p>
'Happiness is such an ephemeral flower, Madame:
memory is its lasting perfume.'
</p>

<p>
For one brief moment her exquisite little hand, white,
soft and tensely alive, like the petals of a fragrant lily,
lay upon his own: for one brief moment of unalloyed happiness
his lips rested upon her finger-tips, and he felt them
quivering beneath his kiss, as if something of the passion
which was searing his heart had been communicated to
her through that kiss.
</p>

<p>
The moment went by like a flash: the next, Monsieur
le Baron d'Inchy was already bidding him farewell with
many an unctuous word, which Gilles never even heard.
He had eyes and ears only for Jacqueline&mdash;Jacqueline,
whom he had seen and loved at first sight, when she had
been alternately proud and dignified, demure and arch,
reproachful and contemptuous; but before whom he could
now bend the knee in adoration when a softened mood
filled her eyes with tears and caused her perfect lips to
quiver with unexpressed sympathy.
</p>

<p>
'I entreat you, Messire,' she said finally, 'when you
return to your master, to urge upon him the necessity of
extreme prudence.  Strangers are none too welcome in
Cambray these days, and Monseigneur de Froidmont hath
already made many enemies, some of whom are unscrupulous,
others merely hot-headed; but all, alas! dangerous.  Guard
him with your life, Messire,' she urged, with a quaint little
catch in her throat.  'And, above all, I pray you to assure
him that Jacqueline de Broyart would give much to undo
the miserable work of the past night.'
</p>

<p>
She bowed her head in token that he was dismissed at
last, and he&mdash;poor wretch!&mdash;could not at that moment
have uttered a single word in response, for his throat was
choked and his very sinews ached with the effort to appear
calm and unconcerned before Monseigneur the governor.
</p>

<p>
So, I fear me, that Gilles de Crohin defied every social
rule laid down by the aforesaid Maître Calviac, and that
Monseigneur the governor was seriously shocked when he
saw a mere equerry taking an unduly hasty leave from
himself and from Madame Jacqueline de Broyart, who was
Duchesse et Princesse de Ramèse, in rank far above any
Sire de Crohin.
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur d'Inchy gave a quick sigh of impatience.
The comedy invented by the Queen of Navarre was beginning
to tax his powers of endurance heavily.  Were it not
for the great issues at stake, he would never have humbled
himself before any man as he had done before a profligate
Valois prince who was not worthy to lick the dust that
stained Madame Jacqueline's velvet shoes.  He looked
down with conscious pride on his beautiful ward, more
beautiful at this moment, he thought, than she had ever
looked before.  She was gazing straight down the length
of the corridor; her lips were parted in an enigmatic smile
which greatly puzzled her old guardian, a soft blush mantled
over her cheeks and throat, and as she gazed&mdash;on nothing
seemingly&mdash;her blue eyes shone with a strange, inward
excitement.
</p>

<p>
And yet, all that there was to see down the corridor was
the retreating figure of that somewhat ill-mannered equerry,
Messire Gilles de Crohin.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
WHICH TREATS OF THE DISCOMFITURE OF M. DE LANDAS
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
We may take it that M. le Baron d'Inchy, at whose
invitation the Duc d'Anjou had come to Cambray,
was not likely to let the matter of the midnight duel remain
unpunished, the moment he learned the full facts about
the affair.  The epistle of Maître Jehan had put him on
the scent, and it must be remembered that M. le Baron
d'Inchy ruled over Cambray and the Cambrésis with the
full autocratic power of a conqueror, and that he had
therefore more than one means at his disposal for forcing the
truth from unwilling witnesses if he had a mind.
</p>

<p>
That truth, as confessed by the night watchmen, was
nothing short of appalling.  Monseigneur the governor's
first thought had been one of ample&mdash;not to say,
obsequious&mdash;apologies to His Highness for the outrage against his
person.  But <i>Monsieur</i> being sick, and etiquette forbidding
Monseigneur the governor's visit to so humble an hostelry
as that of 'Les Trois Rois,' M. d'Inchy had bethought
himself of Messire Gilles de Crohin, the equerry, had sent
for him and begged him to transmit to His Highness all
those excuses which he&mdash;the governor&mdash;would have wished
to offer in person.  Fortunately, the equerry had been able
to assure Monseigneur that His Highness appeared inclined
to look on the affair with leniency.  Whereupon d'Inchy
had seen him depart again, feeling still very wrathful but
decidedly easier in his mind.
</p>

<p>
Then he sent for de Landas.
</p>

<p>
De Landas was sick of his wounds, feverish and in the
leech's hands; but the order to present himself before the
governor was so peremptory that he dared not refuse.  He
knew well that nothing but unbridled anger would cause
Monseigneur to issue such an arbitrary order and that it
would neither be wise nor even safe to run counter to his will.
</p>

<p>
So de Landas had his wounds re-dressed and bandaged;
he took the cooling draught which the leech had prepared
for him, and then he ordered four of his men to carry him
on a stretcher to the Archiepiscopal Palace.  But all this
show of sickness did not have the effect of softening
Monseigneur's mood.  He ordered de Landas very curtly to
dismiss his stretcher-bearers, then he motioned him to a
seat, himself sat down behind his desk and fixed searching
eyes upon his young kinsman.
</p>

<p>
'I have sent for you, José,' he began sternly, 'and for
you alone, rather than for the whole of your gang, because
you have constituted yourself their leader, and they invariably
follow you like so many numskulls, in any mischief
which you might devise.'
</p>

<p>
'Mon cousin&mdash;&mdash;' stammered de Landas, abashed, despite
himself, by d'Inchy's dictatorial tone.
</p>

<p>
'One moment,' broke in the latter harshly.  'Let me
tell you at once that explanations and prevarications are
useless.  I received a hint of what occurred last night
primarily from an outside source, but you will understand
that a clue once obtained can very easily be followed up.
We questioned your varlets, put the night watchmen to
the torture; they confessed everything, and you, M. le
Marquis de Landas, my kinsman, and half a dozen of your
precious friends, stand convicted of an attempt at assassination
against the person of a stranger, who happens to be
my guest.'
</p>

<p>
De Landas, feeling himself cornered, made no attempt
to deny.  It certainly would have been useless.  Unfortunately
he had allowed his jealousy to get the better of his
prudence, and last night had made more than one mistake&mdash;such,
for instance, as not killing the watchmen outright
instead of merely overpowering them, and employing his
own men rather than a few paid spadassins, who could not
afterwards have been traced.  So he sat on, sullen and
silent, his arm resting on that of the chair, his chin buried
in his hand.
</p>

<p>
'For that attempted crime,' resumed Monsieur le Baron
d'Inchy, after a slight pause, and speaking in a trenchant
and staccato tone, 'I have decided to expel you and your
five friends out of the city.'
</p>

<p>
De Landas, forgetting his wounds and his sickness,
jumped to his feet as if he had been cut with a lash.
</p>

<p>
'Expel me&mdash;&mdash;?' he stammered.  He could scarcely
frame the words.  He was grey to the lips and had to steady
himself against the table or he would have measured his
length on the floor.
</p>

<p>
'You and your friends,' reiterated d'Inchy with
uncompromising severity.  'Would you perchance prefer the
block?'
</p>

<p>
But already de Landas had recovered some of his
assurance.
</p>

<p>
'This is monstrous!' he exclaimed hotly.  'I, your
kinsman!  Herlaer, Maarege&mdash;some of your most devoted
friends...!'
</p>

<p>
'No one is a friend,' retorted d'Inchy firmly, 'who is a
law-breaker and a potential assassin!'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur!' protested de Landas.
</p>

<p>
'Well!  What else were you all last night?'
</p>

<p>
'We had no intention of killing the rogue.'
</p>

<p>
'And attacked him, six to one!'
</p>

<p>
'His impudence deserved chastisement.  We only desired
to administer a lesson.'
</p>

<p>
'In what form, I pray you?' queried d'Inchy with a
short ironical laugh.
</p>

<p>
'We had some sticks in reserve&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'Sticks!' thundered d'Inchy, who at the words had
jumped to his feet and in his wrath brought down his
clenched fist with a crash upon the table.  'Sticks!!
You had thought ... you would dare ... to raise your
hands against ... against ... Oh, my God!' he
exclaimed in horror as he sank down once more into his chair
and, resting his elbows on the table, he buried his face in
his hands.  Evidently he was quite unnerved.
</p>

<p>
De Landas had remained silent.  Of a truth he had been
struck dumb by this extraordinary show of what amounted
almost to horror on the part of his usually dignified and
self-contained kinsman.  It seemed as if he&mdash;de Landas&mdash;had
said something awful, something stupendous when he
spoke of administering chastisement to a vagabond.  A
vagabond indeed!  What else was this so-called Prince de
Froidmont?  Whence did he come?  What was his purpose
in coming to Cambray?  And why should Monseigneur
the governor be so completely unnerved at the bare
possibility of any one laying hands on so obscure a personage?
</p>

<p>
But this was obviously not the moment for demanding
an explanation.  De Landas, ere he left his own fatherland
in order to seek fortune in Flanders, had already been well
schooled in those arts of diplomacy and procrastination
for which Spanish statesmen were famous.  He scented a
mystery here, which he then and there vowed to himself
that he would fathom; but this was not the time to betray
his own suspicions.  He knew well enough that these
wooden-headed Flemings were for ever hatching plots for the
overthrow of their Spanish conquerors, that His Majesty the
King of Spain had hardly one faithful or loyal subject among
these boors, who were for ever prating of their independence
and of their civil and religious liberties.  De Landas' quick,
incisive mind had already jumped to the conclusion that,
in this mystery which surrounded the personality of this
enigmatic Prince de Froidmont, there was no doubt the
beginnings of one of those subtle intrigues, which had already
filched from the kingdom of Spain more than one of her
fair Flemish provinces.  But the young man had up to
now been too indolent and too self-indulgent to trouble
himself much about the dangers which threatened his
country through the brewing of these intrigues.  He was of a
truth ready to find fortune in Flanders and to marry the
richest heiress in the land if he could, and then to remain
loyal to the country of his adoption if it continued to suit
his purpose so to do; but if, as he began now vaguely to
fear, his plans with regard to Jacqueline were thwarted
for the sake of some unknown suitor, however highly placed,
if the golden apple which he had hoped to gather in this
mist-laden land turned to dead-sea fruit in his hand, then
he would no longer consider himself bound by allegiance
to this alien country; rather would his loyalty to King
Philip of Spain demand that he should combat every
machination which these abominable Flemings might set afoot,
for the overthrow of Spanish power.
</p>

<p>
But all this was for the future.  De Landas was astute
enough not to betray a single one of his thoughts at the
moment&mdash;not until he had surveyed the whole situation
in cold blood and discussed it with his friends.  For the
nonce, conciliation was the only possible&mdash;the only
prudent&mdash;course of action, and humility and resignation the only
paths thereto.
</p>

<p>
So he waited a minute or two until d'Inchy had mastered
his extraordinary emotion.  Then he said meekly:
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur, you see me utterly confounded by your
anger.  On my honour, I and my friends sinned entirely
in ignorance.  We thought the stranger presumptuous in
the presence of Madame Jacqueline de Broyart, who in
our sight is almost a divinity.  We desired to teach a
malapert a lesson for daring to approach the greatest lady in
Flanders otherwise than on bended knees.  We had no
thought,' he added insidiously, 'that in so doing we might
be attacking a personage whom Monseigneur desires to
hold in especial honour.'
</p>

<p>
'Even if the stranger was a person of no consequence,'
rejoined d'Inchy more calmly, 'your conduct was
outrageous&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'As it is, I am humbled in the dust at thought that it
put a spoke in the wheel of some deep-laid political plans.'
</p>

<p>
'I did not say that&mdash;&mdash;' broke in d'Inchy quickly.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Monseigneur!' protested de Landas gently, 'you
deign to belittle mine intelligence.  I may be a young
jackanapes, but I am not such a crass fool as not to realize that
the person whom I only thought to chastise, as I might
some insignificant groundling, must be a gentleman of more
than ordinary consequence, else you would not punish me
so severely for so venial an offence.'
</p>

<p>
'It is my duty&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To expel six noble gentlemen from their homes for
laying hands on an unknown adventurer?  Fie, Monseigneur!
Your estimate of my reasoning powers must of
a truth be a very low one.'
</p>

<p>
'You have gravely erred against the laws of hospitality.'
</p>

<p>
'I am prepared to lick the dust in my abasement.'
</p>

<p>
'You have offended a stranger who was my guest.'
</p>

<p>
'I will offer him my abject excuses, tell him that I
mistook him for a caitiff.'
</p>

<p>
'He would not accept your excuses.'
</p>

<p>
'Is he such a high and mighty prince as all that?'
retorted de Landas.
</p>

<p>
It was an arrow shot into the air, but it evidently hit
the mark, for d'Inchy had winced at the taunt.
</p>

<p>
'M. le Prince de Froidmont has been too gravely affronted,'
he said stiffly, 'for excuses to be of any avail.'
</p>

<p>
'Let me try them, at any rate,' riposted de Landas,
almost servilely now.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! but Monseigneur, I entreat you, listen.  I am your
friend, your kinsman, have served this land faithfully,
devotedly, for years!  I have no wish to pry into your
secrets, to learn anything of which you desire to keep me
in ignorance.  But think&mdash;think!!  Others would not be
so scrupulous as I.  Gossip flies about very quickly in this
city, and rumours would soon take wider flight, if it became
known that you had punished with such unyielding rigour
six of your best friends, one of them your own kinsman,
for daring to quarrel with a masked stranger whom nobody
knows, and who has entered this city in the strictest
incognito.  People will deduce unpleasant conclusions: some
will call the stranger a Spanish spy, and you, Monseigneur,
a paid agent of Spain.  At best, rumour will be busy with
speculations and conjectures which will jeopardize all your
plans.  In pleading for mercy, Monseigneur,' urged de
Landas with well-feigned ingenuous enthusiasm, ''tis not so
much mine own cause that I advocate, but rather that of
your own peace of mind and the fulfilment of all your secret
desires.'
</p>

<p>
D'Inchy made no immediate reply.  No doubt the Spaniard's
specious arguments had struck him as sound.  He
knew well enough how difficult it was, these days, to keep
tongues from wagging, and until the affair with <i>Monsieur</i>
Duc d'Anjou, was irrevocably concluded, gossip would
prove a deadly danger, not only to the plans which he and
de Lalain had laid so carefully, but also to themselves and
to their adherents.  This knowledge caused him to weaken
in his attitude toward de Landas.  He sat there, frowning,
silent, obviously hesitating already.
</p>

<p>
We must always remember also that the Flemings&mdash;whether
lords or churls&mdash;had never been able to hold their
own against Spanish diplomacy and Spanish cunning.
Their mind was too straightforward, too simple, yes! too
childish, to understand the tortuous subtleties practised
by these past masters of mental craftiness.
</p>

<p>
D'Inchy, de Lalain, de Montigny and their friends had
plunged up to the neck in a sea of intrigue.  They were
already floundering, out of their depth.  D'Inchy, ingenuous
and inherently truthful, had never suspected de Landas
of duplicity&mdash;had, of a truth, never had cause to suspect
him&mdash;therefore now he took the young Spaniard's protestations,
his meekness, his well-timed warning, entirely at their
face value.  De Landas was looking him straight in the face
while he spoke, and d'Inchy was duly impressed by the
air of straightforwardness, of youthful enthusiasm,
wherewith the young man punctuated his impassioned tirade;
and the latter, quick to note every change in the Fleming's
stern features, pursued his advantage, pressed home his
pleadings, half certain already of success.
</p>

<p>
'Let me go forthwith, Monseigneur,' he begged, 'to offer
my humble apologies to&mdash;to&mdash;Monsieur&mdash;er&mdash;le Prince de
Froidmont.  Though you may think that we tried to murder
him last night, we crossed swords with him like loyal
gentlemen.  I and my friends will meekly admit our errors.  He
is too chivalrous, believe me, not to forgive.'
</p>

<p>
Obviously d'Inchy was yielding.  Perhaps he had never
been very determined on punishing those young coxcombs,
had been chiefly angered because he feared that in his wrath
<i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou, might incontinently shake the dust
of inhospitable Cambray from off his velvet shoes.  Above
all things, d'Inchy dreaded gossip about the affair, and de
Landas had indeed proved himself a master in the art of
self-defence when he prophesied the birth of countless
rumours if wholesale expulsions and punishments followed
the midnight brawl.
</p>

<p>
'Have I your permission to go, Monseigneur?' insisted
de Landas.  'Sick as I am, I can yet crawl as far as the
hostelry where lodges the enigmatic Prince de Froidmont.'
</p>

<p>
Again d'Inchy winced.  He felt his secret escaping from
the safe haven of his own keeping.  He sat on in silence,
meditating for awhile.  After all, <i>Monsieur's</i> equerry had
assured him that His Highness was disposed to look leniently
on the episode, and who could be more royalist then the
King? more Catholic than the Pope?  Gradually the
tensity of his attitude relaxed, the dark frown disappeared
from between his brows; he still looked sternly on his
young kinsman, but the latter saw that the look was no
longer menacing.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later Monseigneur d'Inchy had spoken
the word which caused de Landas to give a deep sigh of
relief.
</p>

<p>
'Very well!' he said.  'You may try.  But understand,'
he added inflexibly.  'If Monsieur&mdash;I mean, if M. le
Prince de Froidmont does not accept your apology, if
he demands your punishment, you leave Cambray to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'I understand, Monseigneur,' said de Landas simply.
</p>

<p>
'And if the Prince does accept your apology, and I do
condone your offence this time, your punishment will be
all the more severe if you transgress again.  It would not
be a sentence of expulsion then, but one of death.  Now
you may go!' he concluded curtly.  'My leniency in the
future will depend upon your conduct.'
</p>

<p>
After which, he dismissed de Landas with a stiff inclination
of the head, and the young Spaniard left the presence
of the autocratic governor of Cambray with rage in his
heart and a veritable whirlpool of conjectures, of surmises
and of intrigues seething in his fertile brain.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
But right through the wild medley of hypotheses which
ran riot in de Landas' mind there raged also furious, unbridled
wrath&mdash;wrath at his own humiliation, his own impotence&mdash;hatred
against the man who had brought him to this pass,
and mad, ungovernable jealousy whenever his thoughts
turned to Jacqueline.
</p>

<p>
Somehow&mdash;it was only instinct, no doubt&mdash;he felt that
all this pother about the masked stranger centred round
the personality of Jacqueline.  The first hint which
Monseigneur had of last night's affray must of necessity have
come from Jacqueline.  She alone was there&mdash;varlets and
wenches did not count&mdash;she alone could have a personal
interest in putting Monseigneur on the scent.
</p>

<p>
A personal interest?  De Landas' frown became dark
and savage when first that possibility rose before his mind.
He had ordered his servants, very curtly, to go and wait
for him in the main entrance hall, for after his interview
with the governor he felt the want of being alone for a few
moments, to think over the situation as it so gravely affected
him.  He was in the same corridor where a couple of hours
ago Jacqueline had waylaid and spoken with Messire Gilles
de Crohin.  On his right was the row of tall windows with
their deep embrasures, which gave view upon the park.
De Landas felt sick and fatigued, as much from choler and
nerve-strain as from the effect of his wounds, and he sat
down on one of the wide window-seats to think matters
over.
</p>

<p>
A personal interest?
</p>

<p>
Yes!  That was it.  Jacqueline, capricious, hot-headed,
impulsive, had been attracted by the mysterious personality
of the stranger, and for the moment was forgetting the
lover of her youth, the man who felt that he had an
inalienable claim upon her allegiance.  De Landas had heard
rumours of a masked minstrel having serenaded Madame
beneath her windows.  Pierre, his own henchman, had
received a broad hint to that effect from Nicolle, who was
Madame's waiting-woman.  Was it possible that the masked
troubadour and the enigmatic Prince de Froidmont were
one and the same person? and was it likely that Jacqueline's
romantic fancy had been captured by his wiles?
</p>

<p>
A wild, unreasoning rage gripped at de Landas' heart
at the thought: sheer physical pain caused him to groan
aloud.  He felt stifled and giddy, and with a rough,
impatient gesture, he threw open the casement-window and
leaned out, in order to inhale the pure, fresh air which rose
from the park.  As he did so, he caught sight of Jacqueline,
who was wandering in and among the bosquets, attended
only by one of her maids.  She was dressed in a dark gown
and had a hood over her head, but even thus garbed she
looked adorable, and de Landas muttered an angry oath
as he looked down on her, watching her sedate movements,
the queenly walk, that quaint air of demureness and dignity
which became her so well.  He suddenly realized all that
the past few days&mdash;nay! weeks&mdash;had meant in the shaping
of his destiny.  Monseigneur the governor's stern decree
had already placed her out of his reach; she was slipping
away from him, dragged from his side by her accession to
wealth and power, by the political intrigues which centred
around her&mdash;aye! and she was also slipping away from
him through the gradual cooling of her attachment for him;
that fact he could no longer disguise from himself.  He had
succeeded in winning her, when she was so young and so
inexperienced that she fell readily enough&mdash;almost
unconsciously&mdash;into his arms.  He had ensnared her like the skilful
fowler succeeds in trapping a fledgling unawares.  Since
then, so many things had changed.  Jacqueline, from an
obscure little country wench&mdash;almost the handmaid of an
adulated brother&mdash;had become one of the most important
personages in the land.  She was fêted, courted, admired,
on every side, surrounded by all that was most handsome,
most chivalrous, in Europe.  She had not actually turned
from the lover of her girlhood&mdash;no! even de Landas was
forced to admit that&mdash;but she had learned to appraise him
in the same crucible as other men; and, with teeth set,
and shame and anger gnawing in his heart, de Landas had
to tell himself that she had apparently found him wanting.
Time was when nothing on earth would have turned her
admiration away from him, when, whatever the appearances
might be, she would look up to him as the fount of all
bravery and of all honour.  But last night she had only
been gentle and pitying, and a few hours later had led
Monseigneur into investigating the whole affair.
</p>

<p>
De Landas' fist against the window ledge was clenched
until the knuckles of his slender hand gleamed like ivory.
Had the masked stranger himself aught to do with Jacqueline's
disloyalty?  Suddenly the Spaniard felt that at any
cost he must know the truth about that, at any cost he
must wring an avowal from Jacqueline's lips, whether in
her innermost soul she had ever by one single thought been
unfaithful to him.
</p>

<p>
As fast as his gathering weakness would allow, he hurried
through the interminable corridors of the Palace, until he
found himself down in the hall below, at the foot of the
main staircase, not twenty paces away from the room where
he had endured such bitter humiliation last night.  Instinct
drew him to that room, the window of which gave direct
access on to a terraced walk and thence on to the park.
</p>

<p>
He pushed open the door behind which a few brief hours
ago he and his friends had laid in wait so shamelessly for
their unsuspecting enemy.  Almost furtively he stepped
over the threshold and peeped in.  He scarce recognized
the place, thought he had mistaken the door; and yet
there were all the landmarks: the desk with its
kidney-shaped top, which had proved such a useful rampart for
the enemy; the chairs which the masked stranger had
brandished like swivels above his head when the cowardly
order was given to the varlets to help in the attack; the
heavy curtain which had been the last, the most formidable
weapon of defence.
</p>

<p>
All these things had been put back in their respective
places; a fresh piece of matting covered the floor; the
curtain had been hung once more in front of the window&mdash;not
a stain, not a mark, not a break testified to the terrible
orgy of bloodshed which had desecrated this noble
apartment last night.
</p>

<p>
De Landas looked all about him in astonishment.  He
stepped further into the room, and even as he did so, a
strong current of air caused the heavy door behind him to
fall to with a bang.  As de Landas looked across the room in
order to see what had been the cause of this sudden gust
he saw that the window opposite was open to the ground,
and that Jacqueline had apparently just entered that way
from the terraced walk beyond.
</p>

<p>
She did not see him just at first, but stood for awhile
intent, as he had been, in noting the appearance of the room.
The window framed her in like a perfect picture, with her
dark gown and her golden hair and soft white skin.  The
hood of her cloak had fallen back over her shoulders and
she held her heavy skirt gathered up in her hand.
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline!' exclaimed the young man impulsively.
</p>

<p>
She looked up and saw him, and, quite serenely, stepped
into the room, went forward to greet him with hand
outstretched, her face expressing gentle solicitude.
</p>

<p>
'Why, José!' she said lightly, 'I had no thought of
seeing you to-day.'
</p>

<p>
'Which,' he retorted glumly, 'doth not seem to have
greatly troubled you.'
</p>

<p>
'I knew that you were sick.  Surely the leech hath
prescribed absolute rest.'
</p>

<p>
'I did not think of sickness or of rest,' he rejoined, with
an undercurrent of grim reproach in his tone.  'I only
thought of seeing you.'
</p>

<p>
'I would have come to you,' she said calmly, 'as soon
as the leech advised.'
</p>

<p>
'And I could not wait,' he riposted with a sigh.  'That
is all the difference there is, Jacqueline, between your love
and mine.'
</p>

<p>
Then, as she made no reply, but led him gently, like a
sick child, to a chair, he added sombrely:
</p>

<p>
'I came to bid you farewell, Jacqueline.'
</p>

<p>
'Farewell?  I don't understand.'
</p>

<p>
'I am going away.'
</p>

<p>
'Whither?'
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Chien sabe</i>?' he said.  'What does it matter?'
</p>

<p>
'You are enigmatical, dear cousin,' she retorted.  'Will
you not explain?'
</p>

<p>
'The explanation is over simple, alas!  Monseigneur the
governor hath expelled me from this city.'
</p>

<p>
'Expelled you from this city?' she reiterated slowly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes! for daring to lay hands on His High and Mightiness,
Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont.'
</p>

<p>
'José, you are jesting!'
</p>

<p>
'I was never so serious in all my life.'
</p>

<p>
'And you are going?'
</p>

<p>
'To-night.'
</p>

<p>
'But whither?' she insisted.
</p>

<p>
'As I said before: <i>Chien sabe</i>?'
</p>

<p>
He spoke now in a harsh, husky voice.  Obviously his
nerves were on edge and he had some difficulty in controlling
himself.  He was sitting by the desk and his arm lay across
the top of it, with fist clenched, while his dark eyes searched
the face of the young girl through and through while he
spoke.  She was standing a few paces away from him,
looking down on him with a vague, puzzled expression in
her face.
</p>

<p>
'José,' she said after awhile, 'you are unnerved,
angered, for the moment.  You think, no doubt, that I
am to blame for Monseigneur's knowledge of last night's
affair.  I swear to you that I am not, that on the other
hand I did all that was humanly possible to keep the
shameful affair a secret from every one.'
</p>

<p>
'Shameful, Jacqueline?' he protested.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, shameful!' she replied firmly.  'Monseigneur,
it seems, received an inkling of the truth early this
morning&mdash;how, I know not.  But he sent for the watchmen and
had them examined; then he told me what had occurred.'
</p>

<p>
'And you believed him?'
</p>

<p>
'I neither believed nor disbelieved.  I was hideously,
painfully puzzled.  Now you tell me that my guardian
hath expelled you from this city.  He would not have done
that, José, if he had not proof positive of your guilt.'
</p>

<p>
'Well!' he rejoined with sudden, brusque arrogance.
'I'll not deny it!'
</p>

<p>
'José!'
</p>

<p>
'I did waylay a malapert, an impudent rogue, with the
view to administering a sound correction to his egregious
vanity.  I do not deny it.  I am proud of it!  And you,
Jacqueline, should commend me for having done you
service.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot commend you for last night's work, José,'
she said earnestly.  'It was cowardly and unchivalrous.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardieu!' he riposted roughly.  'I am going to be
punished for it severely enough, methinks.  Expelled from
this town!  Thrown to the tender mercies of the Duke of
Parma and his armies, who will vent on me their resentment
for my loyalty to the Flemish cause!'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, José!  I swear to you that Monseigneur will
relent.'
</p>

<p>
'Not he!'
</p>

<p>
'He only meant to frighten you, to cow you perhaps
into submission.  He was already angered with you after
the banquet, for attacking Messire le Prince de Froidmont.
He thought your action of the night not only a dishonourable
one, but a direct defiance of his orders.'
</p>

<p>
'Not he!' quoth de Landas again.  Then he added with
a sudden burst of bitter resentment.  'He wants to get
me out of the way&mdash;to separate me from you!'
</p>

<p>
'You must not be surprised, José,' she retorted quietly,
'that after what happened last night, my guardian's
opposition has not undergone a change in your favour.  But
have I not sworn that he will relent?  I will go to him
now&mdash;I shall know what to say ... he so seldom refuses
me anything I ask for.'
</p>

<p>
'I forbid you to go, Jacqueline!' he interposed quickly,
for already she had turned to go.
</p>

<p>
'Forbid me?  Why?  I will not compromise your
dignity; have no fear of that.'
</p>

<p>
'I forbid you to go!' he reiterated sullenly.
</p>

<p>
'You are foolish, José!  I assure you that I understand
Monseigneur's moods better than any one else in the world.
I know that he is always just as ready to pardon as to punish.
'Tis not much pleading that I shall have to do.'
</p>

<p>
'You'll not plead for me, Jacqueline.'
</p>

<p>
'José!'
</p>

<p>
'You'll not plead.  'Tis not necessary.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'That I am already pardoned.'
</p>

<p>
'Already pardoned?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  I am not expelled from the city.'
</p>

<p>
'But you told me&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'It was all a ruse!'
</p>

<p>
'A ruse?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes!' he cried with a sudden outburst of rage, long
enough held in check.  'Yes!  A ruse to find out if you loved
me still!'
</p>

<p>
Then, as instinctively, at sight of his face, which had
become distorted with fury, she stepped back in order to
avoid closer contact with him, he jumped up from his
chair, and while she continued to retreat, he followed her
step by step, and she watched him, fascinated and appalled
by the look of deathly hatred which gleamed in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
'A year ago, Jacqueline,' he went on, speaking now
through set teeth, so that his voice came to her like the
hissing of an angry snake; 'a year&mdash;nay, a month, a week
ago&mdash;if I had told you that I was going away from you,
you would have thrown yourself in my arms in the agony
of your grief; you would have wept torrents of tears and
wrung your hands and yielded your sweet face, your full,
red lips unasked to my caresses.  But now&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He paused.  She could retreat no further, for her back
was against the wall.  Instinctively she put out her arms
in order to keep him off.  But he suddenly seized her with
a fury so fierce that she could have screamed with the pain,
which seemed literally to break her back in two.  He held
her close to him, his warm breath scorched her face, his
lips sought her throat, her cheeks, her eyes, with a violence
of passion so intense that for the moment she felt weak and
helpless in his arms.  Only for a moment, however.  The
next, she had recovered that dignified calm which was so
characteristic of her quaint personality.  She made no
resistance, because of a truth she had not the power to shake
herself free from his embrace; but her figure suddenly
became absolutely rigid, and once or twice he met a look
in her eyes which was so laden with contempt, that his
exasperation gave itself vent in a long, impassioned tirade,
wherein he poured forth the full venom of the pent-up
rage, hatred, jealousy which was seething in his heart.
</p>

<p>
'You!  Miserable Flemish cinder-wench!' he cried.
'So you thought that you could toy with the passion of
a Spanish gentleman?  You thought that you could use
him and play with him for just as long as it suited your
fancy, and that you could cast him aside like a torn shoe
as soon as some one richer, greater, more important, appeared
upon the scene.  Well! let me tell you this, my fine
Madame!  That I'll not give you up!  I'll not!  No!
Though I do not love you, any more than I do any slut
who tosses me a passing kiss.  But I'll not give you
up&mdash;to that accursed stranger, or to any man; do you hear?
You are mine, and I'll keep you&mdash;you and your fortune.
I have reckoned on it and I want it&mdash;and I'll have it, if I
have to drag you in the gutter first, or burn this confounded
city about your ears!'
</p>

<p>
His voice had gradually grown more and more husky,
until the last words came out of his parched throat like
the screech of some wild animal gloating over its prey.
But in his present state of health, the effort and the
excitement proved too great for his endurance.  He turned
suddenly dizzy and sick, staggered and would have fallen
headlong at her feet, if she herself had not supported him.
</p>

<p>
She had remained perfectly still while he poured forth
that hideous torrent of insults and vituperation, which, in
her sight, were akin to the writhings of some venomous
reptile.  She could not move or stop her ears from hearing,
because he held her fast.  Tall, stately and impassive,
she had stood her ground like some unapproachable goddess
whom the ravings of a raging cur could not in any way
pollute.
</p>

<p>
Now that he became momentarily helpless, she gave him
the support of her arm and led him quietly back to the
chair.  When he was once more seated and in a fair way
of recovering from this semi-swoon, she&mdash;still quite
calmly&mdash;turned to go.
</p>

<p>
'You are unnerved, José,' she said coldly, 'and had best
remain here now till I fetch your servants.  I could wish
for your sake as well as for mine own that this had been
an everlasting farewell.'
</p>

<p>
After which she walked quite slowly across the room,
opened the door with a firm hand and went out.  A moment
or two later, de Landas could hear her giving instructions
to his servants in a perfectly clear and firm voice.  He
leaned back in his chair and gave a harsh laugh of triumph.
</p>

<p>
'And now, Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont,' he
murmured under his breath, 'we shall see which of us
will be the conqueror in the life and death struggle which
is to come.'

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
HOW M. DE LANDAS PRACTISED THE GENTLE ART OF TREACHERY
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
The conduct of de Landas&mdash;of the one man whom in
her childish way she had at one time loved&mdash;had
been a bitter blow to Jacqueline's sensitive heart, also one
to her pride.  How she could have been so blind as not
to see his baseness behind his unctuous speech, she could
not imagine.  How had she never suspected those languorous
eyes of his of treachery, those full, sensual lips of falsehood?
Now her cheeks still tingled with shame at the remembrance
of those hateful kisses which he had forced on her when
she was helpless, and her whole being quivered with the
humiliation of his insults.  He never, never could have
loved her, not even in the past.  He was just a fortune-hunter,
goaded to desperation when he saw that her wealth
and her influence were slipping from his grasp.  'Flemish
cinder-wench,' he had called her, not just in a moment of
wild exasperation, but because he had always hated her
and her kin and the fair land of Flanders, which she
worshipped and which all these Spanish grandees so cordially
despised.  Jacqueline, whose whole nature&mdash;unbeknown
to herself&mdash;was just awakening from childhood's trance,
felt that she, too, hated now that arrogant and outwardly
pliant Spaniard, the man who with cajoleries and soft,
servile words had wound his way into her heart and into
the confidence of Monseigneur.  She had realized in one
moment, while he was pouring forth that torrent of abuse
and vituperation into her face, that he was an enemy&mdash;a
bitter enemy to her and to her country&mdash;an enemy all
the more fierce and dangerous that he had kept his hatred
and contempt so well concealed for all these years.
</p>

<p>
And now her whole mind was set on trying to find a
means to undo the harm which her own weakness and her
own overtrustfulness had helped to bring about.  Monseigneur
the governor had not of late shown great cordiality
toward M. de Landas; at the same time, he did not appear
to mistrust him, had not yet perceived the vicious claws
underneath the velvet glove or the serpent's tongue behind
the supple speech.  To a sensitive girl, reared in the reserve
and aloofness which characterized the upbringing of women
of high rank in these days, the very thought of confiding
to her guardian the story of de Landas' infamous conduct
towards her was abhorrent in the extreme; but, in spite
of that, she was already determined to put Monseigneur
on his guard, and if mere hints did not produce the desired
effect, she would tell him frankly what had happened, for
Jacqueline's conscience was as sensitive as her heart and
she had no thought of placing her private feelings in direct
conflict with the welfare of her country.
</p>

<p>
But, strangely enough, when she broached the unpleasant
subject with Monseigneur, she found him unresponsive.
What to her had been a vital turning point in her life did
not appear to him as more than a girlish and undue susceptibility
in the face of an aggrieved lover.  He made light of
de Landas' fury, even of the insults which Jacqueline could
hardly bring herself to repeat; and she&mdash;wounded to the
quick by the indifference of one who should have been her
protector and if need be her avenger&mdash;did not insist,
withdrew into her own shell of aloofness and reserve, merely
begging Monseigneur to spare her the sight of de Landas
in the future.
</p>

<p>
This Monseigneur cordially promised that he would do.
He meant to keep de Landas at arm's length for the future,
even though he was quite genuine in his belief that Jacqueline
had exaggerated the violence of the Spaniard's outburst
of hatred.  In his innermost heart, M. le Baron d'Inchy
was congratulating himself that the young girl had been
so completely, if somewhat rudely, awakened from her
infatuation for de Landas.  Matters were shaping themselves
more and more easily with regard to the alliance
which he and his party had so much at heart.  <i>Monsieur</i>
showed no sign of desiring to leave Cambray, which plainly
proved that he had not abandoned the project.  But for
this, as for all delicate political situations, secrecy was
essential above all things, and Monseigneur had received
a severe shock when de Landas had so boldly suggested
that rumour would soon begin to stir around the mysterious
personality of the masked stranger.
</p>

<p>
Because of this, too, d'Inchy did not desire to quarrel
just then with de Landas&mdash;whose misdemeanour he had
already condoned&mdash;and turned a deaf ear to Jacqueline's
grave accusations against her former lover.  The next few
days would see the end of the present ticklish situation and
in the meanwhile, fortunately for himself and his schemes,
most of those young hotheads who had taken part in the
midnight drama were more or less sick, and safely out of
the way.
</p>

<p>
We may take it that M. le Baron d'Inchy heard no further
complaints about the unfortunate affair from his exalted
guest: certain it is that neither M. de Landas nor any of
his friends suffered punishment for that night's dastardly
outrage.  Whether they actually offered abject apologies
to Messire le Prince de Froidmont, we do not know; but it
is on record that the latter made no further allusion to the
affair, and that subsequently, whenever he chanced to meet
any of his whilom enemies in the streets, he always greeted
them with unvarying cordiality and courtesy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
De Landas had in effect burnt his boats.  He knew that
sooner or later Jacqueline's resentment would get the better
of her reserve and that his position inside the city would
become untenable, unless indeed he succeeded in winning
by force what he had for ever forfeited as a right&mdash;the hand
of Jacqueline de Broyart, and with it the wealth, the power
and influence for which his ambitious soul had thirsted to
the exclusion of every other feeling of chivalry or honour.
</p>

<p>
He had left her presence and the Archiepiscopal Palace
that afternoon with hatred and rage seething in his heart
and brain, his body in a fever, his mind torn with conflicting
plans, all designed for the undoing of the man whom he
believed to be both his rival and his deadly enemy.  An
hour later, Du Pret and Maarege, the only two of his friends
who were able to rise from their bed of sickness in response
to a hasty summons from their acknowledged chief, were
closeted with him in his lodgings in the Rue des Chanoines.
A man dressed in rough clothes, with shaggy hair and black,
unkempt beard, stood before the three gallants, in the centre
of the room, whilst Pierre, M. de Landas' confidential
henchman, stood on guard beside the door.
</p>

<p>
'Well?' queried de Landas curtly of the man.  'What
have you found out?'
</p>

<p>
'Very little, Magnificence,' replied the man.  'Messire
le Prince de Froidmont is lying sick at the hostelry of "Les
Trois Rois," and hath not been seen to-day.  His equerry
received a messenger in the course of the morning from
Monseigneur the governor and went subsequently to the
Archiepiscopal Palace, where he remained one hour; and
the henchman started at dawn, on horseback, went out of
the city, and hath not since returned.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardi! we knew all that,' broke in de Landas roughly,
'and do not pay you for such obvious information.  If
you have nothing more to say&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon, Magnificence; nothing else occurred of any
importance.  But I was entrusted with other matter besides
following the movements of Messire le Prince de Froidmont
and his servants.'
</p>

<p>
'Well! and what did you do?'
</p>

<p>
'Obeyed orders.  The people of Cambray are in a surly
mood to-day.  For the first time this morning, food supplies
failed completely to reach the town.  Rumours are rife
that the armies of the Duke of Parma are within ten kilometres
of the gates of the city, and that already he proposes
to starve Cambray into capitulation.'
</p>

<p>
'All that is good&mdash;very good!' assented de Landas,
who nodded to his friends.
</p>

<p>
They too signified their approval of the news.
</p>

<p>
'It is most fortunate,' said young Maarege, 'that all
this has occurred this morning.  It helps our plans
prodigiously.'
</p>

<p>
'Go on, Sancho,' broke in de Landas impatiently.  'What
did you do in the matter?'
</p>

<p>
'I and my comrades mixed with the crowd.  It was easy
enough to throw in a word here and a word there
... the masked stranger in the city ... a banquet at once
given in his honour, where the last food supplies intended
for the people were consumed by those who would sell
Cambray back to the Spaniards ... Spanish spies lurking
in the city....  Oh!  I know how to do that work,
Magnificence!' the man went on with conscious pride.  'You
may rely on me!'
</p>

<p>
'Parbleu, fellow!' retorted de Landas haughtily.  'I
would not pay thee if I could not.'
</p>

<p>
'Well! what else?' queried one of the others eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'As luck would have it, Magnificence,' continued the man,
'one of the strangers&mdash;he who is said to be equerry to the
Prince de Froidmont&mdash;chanced to be walking down the
street when I was by.  I had a small crowd round me
at the time and was holding forth on the subject of Flanders
and her wrongs and the wickedness and tyranny of our
Spanish masters ... I had thrown out a judicious hint
or two about strangers who might be Spanish spies
... Magnificence, you would have been satisfied with the
results!  The crowd espied the stranger, hooted him
vigorously, though for the nonce they dared not actually
lay hands on him.  But 'tis only a matter of time.  The
seeds are sown; within the week, if food becomes more
scarce and dear, you will have the crowd throwing stones
at the stranger! ... I have earned my pay, Magnificence!
Those Flemish dogs are yapping already ... to-morrow
they'll snarl ... and after that...'
</p>

<p>
'After that, 'tis the Duke of Parma who will bring them
back to heel,' concluded de Landas in a triumphant tone.
'And now, Sancho, I have other work for thee!'
</p>

<p>
'I am entirely at the commands of His Magnificence,'
the man rejoined obsequiously.
</p>

<p>
'The seeds here are sown, as thou sayest!  Let Sandro
and Alfonzo and the others continue thy work amongst the
loutish crowds of Cambray.  Thou'lt start to-night for
Cateau-Cambrésis.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Magnificence.'
</p>

<p>
'The Duke of Parma is there.  Thou'lt take a message
from me to him.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Magnificence.'
</p>

<p>
'A verbal message, Sancho; for letters may be stolen
or lost.'
</p>

<p>
'Not when I carry them, Magnificence.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps not.  But a verbal message cannot be lost or
stolen.  If it is not transmitted I'll have thee hanged,
Sancho.'
</p>

<p>
'I know it, Magnificence.'
</p>

<p>
'Well then, thou'lt seek out His Highness the Duke of
Parma.  Tell him all that has occurred in this city&mdash;the
arrival of the stranger; the manner in which he stalks
about the town under cover of a mask; the extraordinary
honour wherewith the governor regards him.  Dost understand?'
</p>

<p>
'Perfectly, Magnificence.'
</p>

<p>
'Then tell the Duke&mdash;and this is the most important
part of thy mission&mdash;that on any given day which he may
select, I can provoke a riot in this city&mdash;a serious riot,
wherein every civil and military authority will be forced
to take a part&mdash;and that this will be the opportunity for
which His Highness hath been waiting.  While the rioters
inside Cambray will be engaged in throwing stones at one
another, the Duke of Parma need only to strike one blow
and he can enter the city unopposed with his armies, in
the name of our Most Catholic King Philip of Spain.'
</p>

<p>
He rose from his chair as he did so and crossed himself
devoutly, his friends doing likewise.  Though they were
Flemish born&mdash;these two young men&mdash;they had for some
unavowable reason espoused the cause of their tyrants,
rather than that of their own people.  A look of
comprehension had darted from Sancho's eyes as he received these
final instructions from his employer, a look of satisfaction,
too, and of hatred; for Sancho was a pure bred Castilian
and despised and loathed all these Flemings as cordially
as did his betters.  Whether he served his own country from
a sense of patriotism or from one of greed, it were impossible
to say.  No one had ever found it worth while to probe
the depths of Sancho's soul&mdash;-a common man, a churl, a
paid spadassin or suborned spy&mdash;he was worth employing,
for he was sharp and unscrupulous; but as to what went
on behind those shifty, deep-set eyes of his and that
perpetually frowning brow, was of a truth no concern of his
noble employers.  All that mattered to them was that
Sancho had&mdash;in common with most men of his type&mdash;an
unavowable past, one which would land him on the cross,
the gibbet or the stake, in the torture-chamber or under
the lash, whenever his duties were ill-performed or his
discretion came to be a matter of doubt.
</p>

<p>
'If you serve me well in this, Sancho,' resumed de Landas
after a brief while, 'the reward will surpass your
expectations.'
</p>

<p>
'In this as in all things,' said the man with obsequious
servility, 'I trust in the generosity of your Magnificence.'
</p>

<p>
'Thou must travel without a safe-conduct, fellow.'
</p>

<p>
'I am accustomed to doing that, Magnificence.'
</p>

<p>
'No papers of any kind, no written word must be found
about thy person, if perchance thou fall into Flemish hands
ere thou canst reach His Highness the Duke of Parma's
camp.'
</p>

<p>
'I quite understand that, Magnificence.'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing wilt thou carry save the verbal message.  And
if as much as a single word of that is spoken to any living
soul save to the Duke of Parma himself, I pledge thee my
word that twenty-four hours later thou shalt be minus thy
tongue, thine ears, thine eyes and thy right hand, and in
that state be dangling on the gibbet at the Pré d'Amour
for the example of any of thy fellows who had thought or
dreamt of treachery.'
</p>

<p>
While de Landas spoke, Sancho kept his eyes resolutely
fixed upon the ground, and his shaggy black beard hid
every line of his mouth.  Nor were de Landas and his
young friends very observant or deeply versed in the science
of psychology, else, no doubt, they would have noticed
that though Sancho's attitude had remained entirely servile,
his rough, bony hand was clutching his cap with a nervy
grip which betrayed a stupendous effort at self-control.
The next moment, however, he raised his eyes once more
and looked his employer squarely and quite respectfully
in the face.
</p>

<p>
'Your Magnificence need have no fear,' he said.  'I
understand perfectly.'
</p>

<p>
'Very well,' rejoined de Landas lightly.  'Then just
repeat the message as thou wilt deliver it before His
Highness the Duke of Parma, and then thou canst go.'
</p>

<p>
Obediently Sancho went through the business required
of him.  'I am to tell His Highness,' he said, 'that on any
day which he may select, Monseigneur le Marquis de Landas
and his friends will provoke a riot within this city&mdash;a serious
riot, wherein every civil and military authority will be forced
to take a part&mdash;and that this will be the opportunity for
which His Highness hath been waiting.  I am to tell him
also that while the rioters inside Cambray will be engaged
in throwing stones at one another, the Duke of Parma
need only to strike one blow and he can enter the city
unopposed, with his armies, in the name of our Most Catholic
King Philip of Spain.'
</p>

<p>
De Landas gave a short, dry laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Thou hast a good memory, fellow,' he said: 'or a
wholesome fear of the lash&mdash;which is it?'
</p>

<p>
'A profound respect for Your Magnificence,' replied
Sancho, literally cringing and fawning now before his noble
master, like a dog who has been whipped; 'and the earnest
desire to serve him well in all things.'
</p>

<p>
'Parbleu!' was de Landas' calm rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
Two minutes later, Sancho was dismissed.  He walked
backwards, his spine almost bent double in the excess of
his abasement; nor did he straighten out his tall, bony
figure till Pierre had finally closed the door after him and
there was the width of an antechamber and a corridor
between him and the possibility of being overheard.  Then
he gave a smothered cry, like that of a choking bull; he
threw his cap down upon the floor and stamped upon it;
kicked it with his foot, as if it were the person of an enemy
whom he hated with all the bitterness of his soul.  Finally
he turned, and raising his arm, he clenched his fist and
shook it with a gesture of weird and impotent menace in
the direction from whence he had just come, whilst in his
deep-set eyes there glowed a fire of rancour and of fury
which of a truth would have caused those young gallants
to think.  Then he picked up his cap and almost ran out
into the street.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
But neither de Landas nor his friends troubled themselves
any further about Sancho once the latter was out of their
sight.  They were too intent on their own affairs to give
a thought to the susceptibilities of a down-at-heel outlaw
whom they were paying to do dirty work for them.
</p>

<p>
'We could not have found a more useful fellow for our
purpose than Sancho,' was de Landas' complacent comment.
</p>

<p>
'A reliable rascal, certainly,' assented Maarege.  'But
it is not easy to get out of the city without a safe-conduct
these days.'
</p>

<p>
'Bah!  Sancho will manage it.'
</p>

<p>
'He might get a musket-shot for his pains.'
</p>

<p>
'That would not matter,' rejoined de Landas with a
cynical laugh, 'so long as his tongue is silenced at the same
time.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, silenced,' urged one of the others; 'but in that
event our message would not be delivered to the Duke of
Parma.'
</p>

<p>
'We must risk something.'
</p>

<p>
'And yet must make sure of the message reaching the
Duke.  We want as little delay as possible.'
</p>

<p>
'If food gets short here our own position will be none
too pleasant.  These Flemings seem to think that the
churls have just as much right to eat as their betters.'
</p>

<p>
'Preposterous, of course,' concluded de Landas.  'But,
as you say, we'll make sure that our message does reach
the Duke as soon as may be.  Let Sancho take one chance.
Pierre shall take the other.'
</p>

<p>
Pierre, motionless beside the door, pricked up his ears
at sound of his own name.
</p>

<p>
'Here, Pierre!' commanded his master.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'Thou hast heard my instructions to Sancho.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'And couldst repeat the message which I am sending
to His Highness the Duke of Parma?'
</p>

<p>
'Word for word, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'Say it then!'
</p>

<p>
Pierre repeated the message, just as Sancho had done,
fluently and without a mistake.
</p>

<p>
'Very well, then,' said de Landas; 'thine instructions
are the same as those which I gave to Sancho.  Understand?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'Thou'lt leave the city to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'Without a safe-conduct.'
</p>

<p>
'I can slip through the gates.  I have done it before.'
</p>

<p>
'Very good.  Then thou'lt go to Cateau-Cambrésis and
present thyself before His Highness.  If Sancho has
forestalled thee, thy mission ends there.  If, however, there has
been a hitch and Sancho has not put in an appearance,
thou'lt deliver the message and bring me back His
Highness' answer.'
</p>

<p>
'I quite understand, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that M. le Marquis de Landas made sure
that his treacherous and infamous message reached the
Generalissimo of the Spanish armies.  To himself and to
his conscience he reconciled that infamy by many specious
arguments, foremost among these being that Jacqueline
had played him false.  Well! he had still a few days before
him wherein to study two parts, one or the other of which
he would have to play on the day when Alexander Farnese,
Duke of Parma, demanded the surrender of the city of
Cambray in the name of His Majesty King Philip of Spain.
The one rôle would consist in a magnificent show of loyalty
to the country of his adoption, the rallying of the garrison
troops under the Flemish flag and his own leadership;
the deliverance of Cambray from the Spanish yoke and
the overthrow of the Duke of Parma and his magnificent
army.  The other rôle, equally easy for this subtle traitor
to play, meant handing over Cambray and its inhabitants
to the tender mercies of the Spanish general, in the hope
of earning a rich reward for services rendered to His Majesty
the King of Spain.  The first course of action would depend
on whether Jacqueline would return to his arms, humbled
and repentant: the second on whether the masked stranger
was indeed the personage whom he&mdash;de Landas&mdash;more
than suspected him of being, namely, <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou
et d'Alençon, own brother to the King of France, come to
snatch the Sovereignty of the Netherlands, together with
their richest heiress, from the arms of her former lover.
</p>

<p>
Well! whichever way matters went, de Landas stood
to win a fair guerdon.  He even found it in his heart to be
grateful to that mysterious stranger who had so unexpectedly
come across his path.  But now he was tired and
overwrought.  His work for the day was done and there was
much strenuous business ahead of him.  So he took leave
of his friends and, having ordered the leech to administer
to him a soothing draught, he finally sought rest.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
WHAT NEWS MAÎTRE JEHAN BROUGHT BACK WITH HIM
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
How Gilles spent the next two or three weeks he could
never afterwards tell you.  They were a long-drawn-out
agony of body and of mind: of body, because the
enforced inactivity was positive torture to such a man of
action as he was; of mind, because the problem of life had
become so complicated, its riddle so unanswerable, that day
after day and night after night Gilles would pace up and
down his narrow room in the Rue aux Juifs, his heart torn
with misery and shame and remorse.  The image of
Jacqueline, so young, so womanly, so unsuspecting, haunted
him with its sweet, insistent charm, until he would stretch
out his arms toward that radiant vision in passionate
longing and call to her aloud to go and leave him, alone with
his misery.
</p>

<p>
He felt that, mayhap under simpler circumstances&mdash;she
being a great lady, a rich heiress, and he an humble soldier
of fortune&mdash;he could have torn her image from his heart,
since obviously she could never become his, and he could
have endured the desolation, the anguish, which after
such a sacrifice would have left him finally, bruised and
wearied, an old and broken man.  But what lay before him
now was, of a truth, beyond the power of human sufferance.
A great, an overwhelming love had risen in his heart almost
at first sight of an exquisite woman: and he was pledged
by all that he held most sacred and most dear to play an
unworthy part towards her, to deceive her, to lie to her,
and finally to deliver her body and soul to that degenerate
Valois Prince whom he knew to be a liar and a libertine,
who would toy with her affections, sneer at her sensibilities
and leave her, mayhap, one day, broken-hearted and
broken-spirited, to end her days in desolation and misery.
</p>

<p>
And it was when the prospect of such a future confronted
Gilles de Crohin in his loneliness that he felt ready to dash
his head against the wall, to end all this misery, this
incertitude, this struggle with the unsolvable problem which stood
before him.  He longed to flee out of this city, wherein
she dwelt, out of the land which gave her birth, out of life,
which had become so immeasurably difficult.
</p>

<p>
Maître Julien tended him with unwearying care and
devotion, but he too watched with burning impatience
for the return of Maître Jehan.  There was little that the
worthy soul did not guess just at this time.  It had not
been very difficult to put two and two together with the
help of the threads which his Liege Lady had deigned to
place in his hands.  But Julien was too discreet to speak;
he could only show his sympathy for a grief which he was
well able to comprehend by showering kindness and attention
on Messire, feeling all the while that he was thereby
rendering service to his divinity.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Despite his horror of inaction, Gilles seldom went out
during that time save at nightfall, and he had been content
to let Monseigneur the governor know that he was still
sick of his wounds.  Indeed, those wounds inflicted upon
him that night by a crowd of young jackanapes had been
a blessing in disguise for him.  They had proved a valid
excuse for putting off the final day of decision which
Monseigneur d'Inchy and his adherents had originally fixed
a fortnight hence.  That fortnight had long since gone by,
and Gilles knew well enough that the Flemish lords were
waxing impatient.
</p>

<p>
They were urging him earnestly for a decision.  The
pressure of the Duke of Parma's blockade upon the city
was beginning to make itself felt.  All access to the French
frontier was now closed and it was only from the agricultural
districts of the province itself that food supplies could be
got into the town; and those districts themselves were
overrun with Spanish soldiery, who pillaged and burned,
stole and requisitioned, everything that they could lay hands
on.  The city of Cambray was in open revolt against her
Sovereign Lord, the King of Spain, and the Duke of Parma
had demanded an unconditional surrender, under such
pains and penalties as would deliver the whole population
to the tender mercies of a conqueror whose final word was
always bloodshed and destruction.
</p>

<p>
A stout garrison, enthusiastic and determined, was in
defence of the city, and there was no thought at present
of capitulation in the valiant hearts of these Flemings, the
comrades and equals of those who had perished in their
hundreds in other cities and provinces of the Netherlands,
whilst upholding their ancient rights and privileges against
the greatest military organization of the epoch.  There
had been no thought of surrender, even though food was
getting scarce and dear.  Wheat and fresh meat had already
become almost prohibitive for all save the rich; clothing
and leather was unobtainable.  The Duke of Parma was
awaiting further troops yet, wherewith he proposed to invest
the city from every side and to cut her population off from
every possible source of supply.
</p>

<p>
This was the inexorable fact which M. le Baron d'Inchy
placed before Gilles de Crohin when the latter presented
himself one day at the Archiepiscopal Palace in his rôle as
equerry to <i>Monsieur</i>.
</p>

<p>
'His Highness must see for himself,' d'Inchy said firmly,
'how impossible it is for us to wait indefinitely on his good
pleasure.  No one can regret more than I do the unfortunate
circumstances which have brought His Highness down to
a bed of sickness; and because of those circumstances&mdash;in
which, alas! I, as Monseigneur's host, had an innocent
share&mdash;I have been both considerate and long-suffering
in not trying to brusque His Highness in his decision.
But Parma is almost at our gates, and Orange is leading
his own army from victory to victory.  We gave in to
Monseigneur's caprice when matters did not appear so urgent
as they are now; time has come when further indecision
becomes a rebuff.'
</p>

<p>
To these very just reproaches Gilles had no other answer
save silence.  Ill-versed as he was in the art of diplomacy,
he did not know how to fence with words, how to parry
this direct attack and to slip out of the impasse in which
he was being cornered.
</p>

<p>
Jehan had been gone a fortnight, and still there was no
answer from the Queen of Navarre!
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur hath a delicate constitution,' he said
somewhat lamely after awhile.  'He suffers grievously
from his wounds and hath been delirious.  It were
unwarrantable cruelty to force a decision on him now.'
</p>

<p>
'So do our people suffer grievously,' retorted d'Inchy
roughly.  'They suffer already from lack of food and the
terror of Parma's armies.  And,' he added with a touch of
grim irony, 'as to His Highness' delicate constitution,
meseems that if a man can hold six young gallants for half
an hour at the sword's point, he hath little cause to quarrel
with the constitution wherewith Nature hath endowed him.'
</p>

<p>
'Even the strongest man can be prostrated by fever.'
</p>

<p>
'Possibly.  But there is no longer any time for procrastination,
and unless I have His Highness' final answer at the
end of the week, my messenger starts for Utrecht to meet
the Prince of Orange.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
When Gilles had taken his leave of Monseigneur the
Governor that afternoon, he felt indeed more perplexed
than he had been before.  Until Madame la Reyne's letter
came, he felt that he could not pledge <i>Monsieur's</i> word
irrevocably.  When he thought over all the events which
had finally landed him in face of so stupendous a problem
his mind hung with dark foreboding on the Duc d'Anjou's
cynical pronouncement: 'If any engagement is entered
into in my name to which I have not willingly subscribed,
I herewith do swear most solemnly that I would repudiate
the wench at the eleventh hour&mdash;aye! at the very foot
of the altar steps!'  And Gilles, as he hurried along the
interminable corridors of the Palace, was haunted by the
image of Jacqueline&mdash;his flower o' the lily&mdash;tossed about
from one ambitious scheme to another, subject to indifference,
to aversion, to insults; unwanted and uncared for
save for the sake of her fortune and the influence which
she brought.  It was monstrous! abominable!  Gilles
felt a wild desire to strangle some one for this deed of
infamy, since he could not physically come to grips with
Fate.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the stairs he saw Jacqueline coming towards
him, and, whether it was the effect of his imagination or of
his guilty conscience, certain it was that she seemed moody
and pale.  He stood aside while she walked past him; but
though his whole being cried out for a word from her and
his every sense yearned for the sound of her voice and a
glance from her eyes, she did not stop to speak to him, only
gave him a kind and gracious nod as she went by.
</p>

<p>
And after he had watched her dainty figure till it
disappeared from his view, he took to his heels and ran out
of the Palace and along the streets, like one who is haunted
by torturing ghosts.  It seemed to him that malevolent
voices were hooting in his ear, that behind walls or
sheltering doorways, there lurked hidden enemies or avenging
ghosts, who pointed fingers of scorn at him as he ran past.
</p>

<p>
'There goes the man,' those accusing voices seemed to
say, 'who would deliver an exquisite lily-flower to be crushed
in the rough and thoughtless hands of an avowed profligate!
There goes the man who, in order to attain that end, is
even now living a double life, playing the part of a liar
and a cheat!'
</p>

<p>
Self-accusation tortured him.  He hurried home, conscious
only of a desire to hide himself, to keep clear of <i>her</i> path,
whom he was helping to wrong.  He paid no heed to the
real hooting that followed him, to the menacing fists that
were levelled at him from more than one street-corner,
wherever a few idlers had congregated or some poor, wretched
churls, on the fringe of want, had put their heads together
in order to discuss their troubles and their miseries.  He
did not notice that men spat in his trail, that women gathered
their children to their skirts when he hurried past, and
murmured under their breath: 'God punish the Spanish spy!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Twenty days went by ere Jehan returned&mdash;twenty days
that were like a cycle of years to the unfortunate watcher
within the city.  Maître Jehan arrived during the small
hours of the morning, drenched to the skin, having swum
the river for a matter of a league or more to avoid the
Spanish sentries, and finally, after having skirted the city
walls, had climbed them at a convenient spot under cover
of darkness, being in as great danger from the guard at the
gates as he had been from the enemy outside.  He had
then lain for an hour or two, hidden in the Fosse-au-Pouilleul,
the most notorious and most comprehensive abode
of thieves and cut-throats known in any city of Flanders.
But the letter which Madame la Reyne de Navarre had
given him for Messire, with the recommendation not to part
with it to any one else save with his life, was still safe
in its leather sheath inside the pocket of his doublet.
</p>

<p>
By the time that the first grey streak of dawn had touched
the tall spires of the ancient city with its wand of silver,
the letter was in Gilles de Crohin's hands, and the two
friends were sitting side by side in the narrow room of the
dreary hostelry, whilst Gilles felt as if a load of care had
been lifted from his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'Your news, my good Jehan?  Your news?' he reiterated
eagerly; 'ere I read this letter.'
</p>

<p>
But Jehan, by dint of broken words and gestures,
indicated that the letter must be read first.
</p>

<p>
So, while he partook of the solid breakfast which Maître
Julien had placed before him, Gilles read the letter which
the gracious Queen had sent to him.  It ran thus:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
'Highly Honoured Seigneur,
</p>

<p class="quote">
'My Faithful and Loyal Friend!
</p>

<p class="quote">
'The present is to tell You that all is well with our
schemes.  I have seen Monsieur, who already is wearied of
Madame de Marquette, and like a School boy who has been
whipped for disobedience, is at this moment fawning round
my Skirts, ready to do anything that I may command.  Was
I not right?  I prophesied that this would be so.  Thus Your
labours on My behalf have not been in fain.  And now I pray
you to carry through the matter to a triumphant conclusion.
In less than three months Monsieur will be Sovereign Lord
of the Netherlands, with the hand of the Flemish Heiress as
a priceless additional guerdon.  In the meanwhile, as no
doubt You know already, the Armies of the Duke of Parma
lie between Us and Cambray.  Monsieur is busy collecting
together the necessary Forces to do battle against the
Spaniards.  He is prepared to enter Cambray in triumph, to
marry the Lady blindfolded, since <i>You</i> say that She is
adorable; in fact He is in the best of moods and consents to
everything which I desire.  Meanwhile, Messire de Balagny,
who is Chief of Monsieur's camp, is on his way with full
details of our projects for the final defeat of the Spaniards.
He has a small troop with him, whom he will leave at La
Fère until after he hath spoken with You.  I urge You,
Messire, in the meanwhile to entreat M. le Baron d'Inchy
not to surrender the City to the Duke of Parma.  I pray You
to assure Him&mdash;in Your name as Duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon&mdash;that
the whole Might of France, of which Messire de
Balagny's small troop is but the forerunner, is at Your beck
and call; that You will use it in order to free the Netherlands
from the Spanish yoke.  Tell him that the next few
months will see the final overthrow of King Philip's domination
in the Netherlands and a prince of the house of France
as their Sovereign Lord.  Say anything, promise anything,
Messire!  I swear to You that Monsieur is prepared to
redeem <i>any</i> pledge You may enter into in his Name.  Then,
when Messire de Balagny arrives in Cambray, You can make
this Your excuse for quitting the City, nominally in order to
place Yourself at the head of Your armies.  Messire de
Balagny, who is in My confidence, will then remain, not only
to take command of the Garrison and help with his small
troop to defend the City from within, but also as a guarantee
for Monsieur's good faith.  See how splendidly I have thought
everything out, how perfectly events are shaping themselves
for the success of Our schemes!  Patience a brief while
longer, Messire!  Your time of trial is drawing to an end!
Confess that it hath not been a very severe ordeal and that
You have derived much enjoyment from mystifying some of
those over obtuse Flemings.  I count with pleasure and
impatience upon Your arrival in La Fère very shortly, where the
gratitude of a sorely tried Queen will be awaiting You.  If
You now help me to carry the affair through to a triumphant
close, I vow that on the day that Monsieur makes his state
entry into Cambray there will be naught that You can ask of
Me and which if in My power to give that I would not
bestow with a joyful heart upon you.
</p>

The letter fell from Messire Gilles' hand unheeded on to
the floor.  He was staring straight out before him, a world
of perplexity in his eyes.  Maître Jehan tried in vain to
fathom what went on behind his master's lowering brow.
Surely the news which he had brought was of the most
cheering and of the best.  The present humiliating position
could not now last very long.  Messire de Balagny was on
his way, and within a few days&mdash;hours, perhaps&mdash;he and
Messire could once more resume those happy, adventurous
times of the past.  And yet it seemed as if Messire was not
altogether happy.  There was something in his attitude,
in the droop of his listless hands, as if something bright
and hopeful had just slipped out of his grasp&mdash;which to
Jehan's mind was manifestly absurd.
</p>

<p>
So he shrugged his wide shoulders and solemnly picked
up the fallen letter and pressed it back into Messire's hand.
The action roused Gilles from his gloomy meditations.
</p>

<p>
'Well, my good Jehan!' he said with a grim laugh,
which grated very unpleasantly on faithful Jehan's ears.
'If the rest of your news is as good as that contained in
Madame la Reyne's letter, you and I will presently find
ourselves the two luckiest devils in Flanders.'
</p>

<p>
Jehan nodded.  'I have n-n-n-no f-f-f-further news,'
he blurted out.  'Messire de B-b-b-b-balagny was at La
F-f-f-fère when I was th-th-there.'
</p>

<p>
'With a strong troop?'
</p>

<p>
Jehan nodded dubiously.
</p>

<p>
'A couple of hundred men?'
</p>

<p>
'Or s-s-s-s-so,' retorted Jehan.
</p>

<p>
'But he himself will be within sight of Cambray to-day?'
</p>

<p>
'A-a-a-at this hour.'
</p>

<p>
'And inside the city to-morrow?'
</p>

<p>
Jehan nodded again.
</p>

<p>
'And Monseigneur le Duc d'Anjou?'
</p>

<p>
'In P-p-p-p-aris: ready to st-st-st-start.'
</p>

<p>
'He does not mean to play a double game this time?'
</p>

<p>
'No-n-n-n-no-no!' came in rapid and vigorous protest
from Maître Jehan.
</p>

<p>
'Then the sooner I secure his bride for him, the better
it will be for Madame la Reyne's schemes,' concluded Gilles
dryly.  Then suddenly he jumped to his feet, gave a deep
sigh, and stretching out his arms with a gesture of
impatience and of longing, he said: 'If we could only vacate
the field without further ado, honest Jehan! and let Fate
do the rest of the dirty work for us!'
</p>

<p>
His hand as it fell back came in contact with his sword,
which was lying across the table; not the exquisite Toledo
rapier, the gift of a confiding Queen, but his own stout,
useful one, which he had picked up some three years ago
now, after his own had been broken in his hand on the field
of Gembloux.  There it lay, the length of its sheath in
shadow; but the slanting rays of the early morning sun
fell full upon the hilt, which was shaped like a cross.  With
it in his hand, with that cross-hilt before his eyes, Gilles
de Crohin had sworn by all that he held most sacred and
most dear that he would see this business through and
would not give it up, until Marguerite of Navarre herself
gave him the word.  And these were days when the sworn
word was a thing that was sacred above all things on this
earth; and as Gilles himself had said it on that same
memorable occasion, he was not a prince and he could not afford
to toy with his word&mdash;it was the only thing he possessed.
Therefore, though more than one historian, notably
Enguerrand de Manuchet, has chosen to cast a slur upon
Gilles de Crohin for his actions, I for one do not see how
he could have acted otherwise and kept his honour intact.
He was pledged to Marguerite de Navarre, had pledged
himself to her with eyes open and full knowledge of the
Duc d'Anjou's character.  To have turned back on his
promise, to have broken his word to the Queen, would have
been the act of a perjurer and of a coward.  He could at
this precise moment have walked out of Cambray, that we
know.  The Duke of Parma's armies at the time that
Balagny succeeded in reaching Cambray only occupied
that portion of the Cambrésis which adjoined the French
frontier.  On the West the way lay open, and the whole
world on that side was free to the soldier of fortune, even
though he would have been forced, after such a course of
action, to shake the dust of France for ever from his feet.
</p>

<p>
But he chose to remain.  He chose to continue the
deception which had been imposed upon him, even though it
involved the happiness of the woman he loved, even though
it meant not only to relinquish her to another man, but
to a man who was wholly unworthy of her.
</p>

<p>
Far be it from the writer of this veracious chronicle to
excuse Gilles de Crohin in what he did.  I do not wish to
palliate, only to explain.  Far be it from me, I say, to run
counter to Messire de Manuchet's learned opinion.  But
the history of individuals as well as that of nations has a
trick of seeming more clear and more proportionate when
it is viewed through the glasses of centuries, and it is just
possible&mdash;I say it in all humility&mdash;that Messire de
Manuchet, who in addition to being a very capable historian
was also a firm adherent of the policy of a French alliance
for the sorely stricken Netherlands, felt aggrieved that
Madame Jacqueline de Broyart, the fairest heiress in
Flanders, did not after all wed <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Alençon et
d'Anjou, own brother to the King of France, and did not
thereby consolidate that volatile Prince's hold upon the
United Provinces, and that the learned historian hath vented
his disappointment in consequence on the man who ultimately
failed to bring that alliance about.
</p>

<p>
That, of course, is only a surmise.  Messire de Manuchet's
history of that stirring episode was writ three hundred years
ago: he may have been personally acquainted with the
chief actors in the palpitating drama&mdash;with d'Inchy and
Jacqueline de Broyart, with Gilles de Crohin and the
Marquis de Landas; even with the Queen of Navarre and
<i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou.  He may also have had his own
peculiar code of honour, which was not the one laid down
by Du Guesclin and Bayard, by Bussy d'Amboise and
Gilles de Crohin, and all the protagonists of chivalry.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
HOW MESSIRE DE LANDAS' TREACHERY BORE FRUIT
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
It is Messire Enguerrand de Manuchet who tells us that
on the 3rd day of April of this same year of grace 1581,
Messire de Balagny, Maître de Camp to <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou
succeeded under cover of darkness in entering the city by
the Landrecy road on the West, which was still&mdash;an you
remember&mdash;clear of the Spanish investing armies.  He came
alone, having left his troop at La Fère, a matter of three
leagues or so.  Toward nine o'clock of the morning he made
his way to the hostelry of 'Les Trois Rois,' where we may
take it that Gilles de Crohin was mightily glad to see him.
Messire de Balagny's advent was for the unfortunate
prisoner like a breath of pure air, something coming to him
from that outside world from which he had been shut out
all these weary weeks; something, too, of the atmosphere
of camps and of clean fighting in the open, which for the
moment seemed to dissipate the heavy fumes of political
intrigues, with its attendant deceits and network of lies,
that were so abhorrent to the born soldier.
</p>

<p>
'I do not envy you your position, my dear friend,' Balagny
said dryly, after he had discussed the whole situation with
Gilles.
</p>

<p>
'My God!' responded Gilles with almost ludicrous
fervour.  'It has been a positive hell!'
</p>

<p>
'Although Madame la Reyne de Navarre is very grateful
to you for what you have done; she was only saying to
me, before I left, that there was nothing she would not do
for you in return.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' said Gilles with a careless laugh.  'The gratitude
of a Queen...!!'
</p>

<p>
'This one is above all a woman,' broke in the older man
earnestly.  'She is a Queen only by the accident of birth.'
</p>

<p>
'I know, I know,' Gilles went on, somewhat impatiently.
'But for the nonce Her Majesty has conferred the greatest
possible boon upon me by releasing me from my post;
and I, being more than satisfied, will ask nothing better
of her.  But what about His Highness?' he added, after
a slight pause.
</p>

<p>
Balagny shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'He does not mean to play us false?' insisted Gilles.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Chien sabe</i>?' was the other's enigmatic reply.  'Does
one ever know what François, Duc d'Anjou, may or may
not do?'
</p>

<p>
'But Madame la Reyne declares&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Madame la Reyne is blind where that favoured brother
is concerned.  But it is she who, even now, is moving heaven
and earth to recruit the armies for the relief of Cambray&mdash;not
he.  As you know, brother Henri, King of France,
will not stir a finger to help Monsieur conquer a possible
kingdom, and <i>Monsieur</i> himself sits in his Palace in Paris,
surrounded by women and young sycophants, idling away
his time, wasting his substance, while his devoted sister
wears herself out in his service.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't I know him!' concluded Gilles with a sigh.  Then
after awhile he added more lightly: 'Well, friend, shall we
to the governor?  He hath sent me a respectful but
distinctly peremptory request this morning to present myself
in person at the Archiepiscopal Palace.'
</p>

<p>
'The worthy Fleming is getting restive,' was de Balagny's
dry comment.
</p>

<p>
'Naturally.'
</p>

<p>
'He wants to bring matters to a head.'
</p>

<p>
'To-day, apparently.  He hath given me respite after
respite.  He will not wait any longer.  Matters in this
city are pretty desperate, my friend.  And if <i>Monsieur</i>
tarries with his coming much longer...'
</p>

<p>
De Balagny rose from his chair, and going up to Gilles,
he placed a kindly hand on the younger man's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Monsieur</i> will not tarry much longer,' he said earnestly.
'Madame la Reyne will see to that.  Go to the governor,
my good Gilles, and complete the work you have so ably
begun.  It was not pleasant work, I'll warrant, and there
is little or no glory attached to it; but when you will have
lived as many years as I have, you will realize that there
is quite a deal of satisfaction to be derived out of inglorious
work, if it be conscientiously done.  And after to-day,' he
added gaily, 'you will be free to garner a whole sheaf of
laurels in the service of a grateful Queen and of a dissolute
Prince.'
</p>

<p>
But Gilles was not in the humour to look on the bright
side of his future career.  He was fingering moodily the
letter which Monseigneur the governor had sent him an
hour or so ago.  It was obviously intended to be the
forerunner of the final decision which would throw
Jacqueline&mdash;beautiful, exquisite Jacqueline of the merry blue eyes
and the rippling laugh&mdash;into the arms of that same dissolute
Prince of whom even de Balagny&mdash;his trusted Maître
de Camp&mdash;spoke with so much bitterness.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
'Were I a free agent,' d'Inchy said in his letter, 'I would
not dream of asking Your Highness so signal a favour; but
while Your Highness chooses to hide Your identity under a
mask, and in an humble Abode altogether unworthy of Your
rank, I have no option but to beg You most humbly to grace
My own house with Your presence, in order that We may
arrive at last to an irrevocable decision in the Matter which
lies so closely to My heart.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Indeed the die was cast.  Even Messire de Manuchet
admits that Gilles could not do otherwise than present
himself at the Palace in accordance with Monseigneur the
governor's desire.  De Balagny certainly did everything to
cheer and encourage him.
</p>

<p>
'Will you not come with me?' Gilles asked of him, when
he was ready to go.  'I could then present you at once to
d'Inchy, and, please God! be myself out of Cambray ere
the sun has begun to sink low in the West.'
</p>

<p>
But Balagny shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'You had best go alone, this once more,' he said firmly.
'Think of the coming interview as an affair of honour,
my dear Gilles, and go to it as you would to a fight, with
a bold front and unquaking heart.  You will find it quite
easy to confront the Fleming then.'
</p>

<p>
Gilles gripped the old man's hand with gratitude.
</p>

<p>
'You have put new life into me,' he said, with something
of his habitual cheerfulness.  'Another few hours of this
miserable business and I shall be free&mdash;free as air!'  Then
he added with a bitter sigh, which the other man did not
quite know how to interpret: 'And I shall imagine myself
as almost happy!'
</p>

<p>
After which, he sallied forth into the street with a firm
and elastic step.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
There are few things in the world quite so mysterious as
the origin and birth of a rumour.  It springs&mdash;who knows
whence? and in a trice it grows, hurries from mouth to
mouth, gathers crowds together, imposes its presence in
every house, at every street corner, on every open space
where men and women congregate.
</p>

<p>
Messire de Balagny had only been inside Cambray a
few hours.  He had entered the city under cover of
darkness and in secrecy, and even before midday the rumour
was already current in the town that the King of France
was sending an army against the Spaniards, and that his
ambassador had arrived in Cambray in order to apprise
Monseigneur the governor of the happy event.
</p>

<p>
It was also openly rumoured that the arrival of this same
ambassador of the King of France was not altogether
unconnected with the activities of Spanish spies inside
the city.  The people, who were beginning to suffer
grievously from shortage of food and lack of clothing, were
murmuring audibly at the continued presence of strangers
in their midst, who were more than suspected of aiding the
Duke of Parma from within, by provoking riots or giving
away the secrets of the garrison and of the stronghold.
</p>

<p>
Above all, there had been growing ill-will against the
masked stranger, the mysterious Prince de Froidmont,
whose persistent stay in this beleaguered city had given
rise at first to mere gossip, but latterly to more pronounced
suspicion, plentifully sprinkled with malevolence.  The
extraordinary deference which Monseigneur the governor
had been observed to show him on more than one occasion
fostered the growing suspicion that he was a stranger of
great distinction, who for some unavowable reason desired
to preserve an incognito, and chose to dwell in an obscure
hostelry, in order that he might cany on some nefarious
negotiations unchecked.
</p>

<p>
Crowds are always unreasonable when skilfully handled
in the direction of suspicion and unrest by unscrupulous
agitators, and we know that de Landas' paid hirelings had
been busy for weeks past in fomenting hatred against the
masked stranger, amongst a people rendered sullen and
irritable both by hunger and by the threat of an invading
and always brutal soldiery at their gates.
</p>

<p>
Certain it is that, the moment that Gilles set foot that
day outside his lodgings in the Rue aux Juifs, he was
followed not only by glances of ill-will, but also by open
insults freely showered after him as he passed.  He was
wearing the rich clothes which would have been affected
by <i>Monsieur</i> on such an occasion; his toil-worn hands
were hidden beneath gloves of fine chamois leather and his
face was concealed by a black velvet mask.  Looking neither
to right nor left, absorbed in his own thoughts, he hurried
along the street, paying no heed to what went on around
him.  It was only when he reached the Place Notre Dame,
in front of the cathedral, and tried in crossing toward the
Archiepiscopal Palace to avoid a group of people who stood
in his way, that he began to perceive something of the
intense hostility which was dogging his every footstep.
</p>

<p>
'Look at the Spaniard!' a woman shouted shrilly out
of the crowd.  'Wants the place to himself now!'
</p>

<p>
'Dressed in silks and satins, when worthy folk go half
naked!' called out another, with bitter spite ringing in
her husky voice.
</p>

<p>
'How much does the King of Spain pay you, my fine
gallant, for delivering the girls of Cambray to his soldiery?'  This
from a short, square-shouldered man, only half-dressed
in a ragged doublet and hose, shoeless and capless, who
deliberately stood his ground in front of Gilles, with bare
arms akimbo and bandy legs set wide apart, in an attitude
of unmistakable insolence.
</p>

<p>
Gilles, with whom patience was at no time a besetting
virtue, uttered an angry exclamation, seized the fellow
incontinently by the shoulder and forced him to execute
a wild pirouette ere he fell back gasping, after this unexpected
attack, against his nearest companions.
</p>

<p>
This brief incident naturally exasperated the crowd: it
acted as a signal for a fresh outburst of rage and a fresh
volley of insults, which were hurled at the stranger from
every side.
</p>

<p>
'Miserable Spaniard!' exclaimed one man.  'How dare
you lay a hand on a free burgher of the city?'
</p>

<p>
'If a free burgher of the city chooses deliberately to insult
me,' retorted Gilles, who, for obvious reasons, was trying
to keep his temper, 'I do what every one of you would
have done under like circumstances&mdash;knock the impudent
fellow down.'
</p>

<p>
'Impudent fellow!' came from a harsh voice at the
rear of the crowd.  'Hark at the noble Spanish Senor!
Flemish burghers are like the dust beneath his feet.'
</p>

<p>
'I am no Spaniard!' said Gilles loudly.  'And whoever
calls me one again is a liar.  So, come out of there,' he
added lightly, 'you who spoke from a safe and convenient
distance; and Fleming, French or Spaniard, we'll soon
see whose is the harder fist.'
</p>

<p>
'Fight with a masked spy like you?' was the defiant
riposte.  'Not I!  The devil, your accomplice, has taught
you some tricks, I'll warrant, against which no simple
Christian could stand.'
</p>

<p>
'Well said!' shouted one of the women.  'If you are
no Spaniard and no spy, throw down that mask and show
your face like an honest man!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes!  Yes!  Throw down the mask!' another in
the crowd assented.  'We know you dress like a fine gallant;
but we want to see how like your face is to the picture
of Beelzebub which hangs in the Town Hall.'
</p>

<p>
A prolonged shout of ribald laughter, which had no merriment
in it, was the unanimous response to this sally.  The
women were already raising their fists: the ever-recurring
insult, 'Spanish spy!' had the effect of whipping up
everybody's temper against the stranger.  Gilles was defenceless
save for his sword, which it would obviously have been
highly impolitic to draw against that rabble.  Whilst he
parleyed with them, he had succeeded by a deliberate
manoeuvre in drawing considerably nearer to the high wall
of the Archiepiscopal Palace, where the latter abuts on the
cathedral close, and he hoped with some good luck, or a
sudden, well-thought-out ruse, to reach the gates ere the
hostility of the crowd turned to open attack.
</p>

<p>
That both the men and the women&mdash;oh! especially the
women!&mdash;meant mischief, there could be no doubt.  There
was that gruff murmur going the round, which means
threats muttered between closed teeth; sleeves were being
rolled above brawny or gaunt arms; palms moistened ere
they gripped stick or even knife a little closer.  Gilles saw
all these signs with the quick, practised eye of the soldier,
and it was his turn to grind his teeth with rage at his own
impotence to defend himself adequately if it came to blows.
Just for the moment the crowd was still sullen rather than
openly aggressive, and, much as the thought of beating a
retreat went against the grain of Gilles' hot temperament,
there was no doubt that it were by far the wisest course to
pursue.
</p>

<p>
But there were one or two units in the midst of that gang
who were determined that the flame of enmity against
the stranger should not die for want of fuel.  They were
apparently on the fringe of the malcontents, in a safe position
in the rear, and from there they threw out a word now and
again, a sneer or an insult, whenever there appeared the
slightest slackening in the hostile attitude of their friends.
</p>

<p>
'He wouldn't like to show us his face,' one of this gentry
said now, with a mocking laugh; 'for fear we should see
how bloated he is with good food and wine.'
</p>

<p>
'Spawn of the devil!' at once screeched a gaunt, hungry-looking
wretch, and ostentatiously tightened his belt around
his middle.  'They all gorge while we starve!'
</p>

<p>
'And wallow in riches, while honest citizens have to beg
for their daily bread!'
</p>

<p>
A woman, still young, and who might have been comely
but for the miserable appearance of her unwashed face and
lank, matted hair, pushed her way through the throng right
into the forefront of the men.  She dragged a couple of
half-naked children in her wake, who clung weeping to her ragged
skirts.
</p>

<p>
'Look at these!' she screamed harshly, and thrust a
fist as close to Gilles' face as she dared.  'Look at these
children!  You miserable spy!  Starving, I tell you!
Starving!  While your satin doublet is bursting with Spanish
gold!'
</p>

<p>
'Aye!' came with renewed vigour from the rear.  'The
price of our sons' lives, of our daughters' honour, are
sacrificed to the tyranny and the debauchery of such as you!'
</p>

<p>
'Shame!  Shame!' came in a dull, ominous murmur
from the rest of the throng.
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt that tempers were waxing more
and more ugly.  In more than one pair of bloodshot eyes
which were glaring at him, Gilles saw the reflection of a
lust which was not far removed from that of murder.  It
was no use looking on the matter with indifference; his
life was being threatened, and there were men actually
present among the crowd who were making it their business
to goad this rabble into ever-increasing fury.  The latter
were in themselves too obtuse to realize that they were
acting under guidance, that their choler would no longer
be allowed to cool down nor they permitted to let the
stranger go unmolested.  Their tempers, their own
stupidity, their miseries, poor wretches, had made them the
slaves of de Landas' gang.
</p>

<p>
Gilles had been shrewd enough to suspect the plot almost
from the first.
</p>

<p>
'I marvel,' he had already said to himself, 'if my gallant
with the Spanish accent and the languorous eyes has had
a finger in this delectable pie.  Between employing paid
spadassins to commit deliberate murder and egging on a
set of hungry wretches into achieving manslaughter, there
is little to choose, and Messire de Landas has no doubt
adopted the less risky course.'
</p>

<p>
But for the nonce self-preservation became the dominant
necessity, and Gilles, feeling himself so closely pressed that
his free movements were becoming hampered, executed a
swift manoeuvre of retreat which landed him a second or
two later with his back against the high encircling walls
of the Archiepiscopal Palace, and with the stately limes of
the Palace gardens waving their emerald-laden branches
above his head.  Were his position not quite so precarious,
he might have laughed aloud at its ludicrousness.  He,
Gilles de Crohin, masquerading as a Prince of Valois, and
set upon for being a Spanish spy!!  That fellow, de Landas,
was a clever rogue!  But it was a dirty trick to use these
wretched people as his tools!
</p>

<p>
Aloud, he shouted, as forcibly and vigorously as he could:
'Now then, my friends!  Have I not already told you
that I am no Spaniard?  I am a Frenchman, I tell you,
and my Liege Lord the King of France is even at this hour
busy trying to free you from your Spanish tyrants.  He&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Hark at him!' came at once, to the accompaniment
of deafening clamour, from the rear.  'Feeding us with
lies.  'Tis the way of spies to assume any guise that may
suit their fancy or their pocket.  Friends!  Citizens!
Do not let the Spaniard trick you!  Why is he here, I ask
you?  If he is a Frenchman, why doth he go about masked?
What is he doing here?  Bargaining with the Duke of
Parma, I say, with your lives and your liberties.'
</p>

<p>
'Silence, you fool!' cried Gilles, in stentorian tones.
'You miserable cur!  Who pays you, I would like to know,
to incite these poor people to break the laws of peace and
order?'
</p>

<p>
'Peace and order, forsooth!' retorted the voice from the
rear, with a prolonged, harsh laugh.  'You want peace,
no doubt, so that your master the Spanish King can work
his way with Cambray, send his soldiers into our city to
burn our houses, pillage our homes, outrage our wives and
daughters!  Citizens, remember Mechlin!  Remember
Mons!  Beware lest this man sell your city to the Spaniards
and you reap the same fate as your kinsmen there!'
</p>

<p>
A stupendous cry of rage and execration greeted this
abominable tirade&mdash;as abominable, indeed, as it was
ludicrous.  One moment of sober reflection would have
convinced these poor, deluded fools how utterly futile and false
were the assertions made by those who were goading them
to exasperation.  But a crowd never does reflect once it
is aroused, once a sufficient number of hotheads are there,
ready to drive them from empty bluster to actual violence.
The paid agents of M. de Landas had done their work well.
They had sown seeds of disaffection, of mistrust and of
hostility, for days past and weeks; now they were garnering
just the amount of excitement necessary to bring about a
dastardly crime.
</p>

<p>
Gilles, with his back against the wall, was beginning to
think that he would have to make a fight for it after all.
Already the crowd was closing in around him, pressing
closer and closer, completing the semicircle which barred
his only means of escape.  He tried to make himself heard,
but he was shouted down.  The work of the agitators was
indeed complete; the rabble needed no more egging on.
Men and women were ready for any mischief&mdash;to seize the
stranger, tear off the rich clothes from his back, ransack
his pockets, knock him on the head and finally drag him
through the streets and throw him either into the river or
over the battlements into the moat.
</p>

<p>
It became a question now how dearly Gilles would be
able to sell his life.  He could no longer hope to reach
the gates of the Palace, and the vast courtyard, gardens
and precincts which surrounded the house itself rendered
it highly improbable that any one would hear the tumult
and come to his assistance.  Over the heads of the crowd,
he could see the great, open Place where a patrol of the town
guard was wont to pass from time to time on its beat.  For
some unexplainable reason there appeared to be no patrol
in sight to-day.  Had they been bribed to keep out of the
way?  It was at least possible.  Some one had evidently
planned the whole of this agitation, and that some
one&mdash;an unscrupulous devil, thought Messire, if ever there was
one!&mdash;was not like to have left the town guard out of his
reckoning.
</p>

<p>
Even while Gilles took this rapid, mental survey of his
position, one of the men in the rear had suddenly stooped
and picked up a loose stone out of the gutter.  Gilles saw
the act, saw the man lift the stone, brandish it for a moment
above his head and then fling it with all his might.  He
saw it just in time to dodge the stone, which struck the wall
just above his head.
</p>

<p>
'Not a bad fling, my man,' he said lightly.  'But
'twas the act of a coward!'
</p>

<p>
Then he drew his sword&mdash;was forced to do it, because
the crowd were pressing him close, some with sticks, others
with fists.  The square-shouldered man of awhile ago&mdash;he
with the bandy legs&mdash;had a butcher's knife in his hand.
</p>

<p>
'Murder!' shrieked the women, as soon as Gilles' sword
darted out of its sheath like a tongue of living flame.
</p>

<p>
'Aye, murder!' he riposted.  'I can see it in your
eyes!  So stand back, all of you, or the foremost among
you who dares to advance is a dead man.'
</p>

<p>
They did not advance.  With a churl's natural terror of
the sword, they retreated, realizing for the first time that
it was a noble lord, an exalted personage whom, in their
blindness, they had dared to attack.  Spaniard or no, he
was a gentleman; and suddenly the thought of floggings
or worse for such an outrage dissipated the fumes of folly,
which some unknown person's rhetoric had raised inside
their brains.
</p>

<p>
De Landas' agents in the rear saw this perceptible retreat.
Another moment or two, and their carefully laid schemes
would certainly come to naught.  Failure for them now
was unthinkable.  The eyes of their employer were
undoubtedly upon them, even though they could not see him, and
they knew from past bitter experience how relentless the
young Spanish lord could be if his will was thwarted through
the incompetence of his servants.  One of them&mdash;I think
his name was Jan&mdash;bolder than the others, called to his
comrades and to those on the fringe of the crowd who had
not been scared by the sight of that fine Toledo blade,
gave them the lead, which they promptly followed, of
picking up more stones out of the gutter and flinging them at
the stranger one after another in rapid succession.  Some
of this stone-throwing was very wild, and Gilles was able
to dodge most of the missiles, whilst others actually hit
some of the crowd.  A woman received one on the shoulder;
the bandy-legged bully another on the head.  Blood now
was flowing freely, and the sight of blood acts on a
turbulent crowd in the same way as it does on a goaded bull.
No longer frightened of the sword, the riotous crew began
to attack the stranger more savagely.  One man struck at
him with a stick, another tried to edge nearer in order to
use a knife.
</p>

<p>
Stones were being flung now from every point, and soon
it became impossible to dodge them all.  The crowd had
become a screeching mob, bent on outrage and on murder.
The screams of women, the cries of little children, mingled
with hoarse cries of rage and volleys of unspeakable
insults.  The sight of blood had of a truth turned a knot
of malcontents into a pack of brute beasts, fuming with an
insatiable desire to kill.
</p>

<p>
As fast as the stones fell around him, Gilles picked them
up and flung them back.  These seldom missed their mark,
and already several of his assailants had been forced to
retreat from the field.  But now a piece of granite hit him
on the sword-arm and he had barely the time to transfer
his sword to his left hand in order to ward off a thrust
aimed at him with a knife, just below the belt.  His right
arm hung limp by his side, aching furiously; a small piece
of sharp stone had grazed his forehead, and with an
unconsidered gesture, he tore the mask from his face, for the
blood was streaming beneath it into his eyes.  But that
movement&mdash;wellnigh instantaneous as it was&mdash;placed
him at a greater disadvantage still, for another stone,
more accurately aimed than some others, hit his left arm
so violently that, but for an instinctive, nervy clutch on
the hilt, his sword would have fallen from his grasp.
</p>

<p>
After that, he remembered nothing more.  A red veil
appeared to interpose itself between his eyes and that mass
of vehement, raging, perspiring humanity before him.
Each individual before him seemed to the weary fighter
to assume greater and ever greater proportions, until he
felt himself confronted with a throng of giants with distorted
faces and huge, ugly jaws, through which a hot fire came,
searing his face and obscuring his vision.  Instinctively he
still dodged the missiles, still parried with his sword; but
his movements were mechanical; he felt that they were
becoming inefficient ... that he himself was exhausted
... vanquished.  Vaguely he marvelled at Destiny's
strange caprice, which had decreed that he should die,
assassinated by a set of shrieking men and women, whom
he had never wronged even by a thought.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly the whole wall behind him appeared to
give way, and he sank backwards into oblivion.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
HOW A SECOND AWAKENING MAY BE MORE BITTER THAN THE FIRST
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
It all seemed like the recurrence of that lovely dream
of long ago&mdash;the awakening to a sense of well-being
and of security; the sweet-smelling couch; the clean
linen; the fragrance of the air, and above all the tender,
pitying blue eyes and the tiny brown mole which challenged
a kiss.
</p>

<p>
When Gilles opened his eyes, he promptly closed them
again, for fear of losing that delicious sensation of being
in dreamland, which filled his whole body and soul with
inexpressible beatitude.  But even as he did so, a gentle
voice, light and soothing as the murmur of a limpid stream,
reached his ear.
</p>

<p>
'Will you not look up once more, Messire,' the angelic
voice said softly, 'and assure me that you are not grievously
hurt?'  And oh! the little tone&mdash;half bantering, wholly
sympathetic&mdash;which rippled through those words with a
melodious sound that sent poor Gilles into a veritable heaven
of ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
But he did look up, just as he was bidden to do&mdash;looked
up, and encountered that tantalizing little mole at such
close quarters that he promptly raised his head, so that
his lips might touch it.  Whereupon the mole, the blue
eyes, the demure smile, the whole exquisite face, retreated
with lightning rapidity into some obscure and remote
distance, and Gilles, conscious that only gentle pity would
bring them nearer to him again, groaned loudly and once
more closed his eyes.
</p>

<p>
But this time these outward signs of suffering were
greeted with a mocking little laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Too late, Messire!  You have already betrayed yourself.
You are not so sick as you would have me believe!'
</p>

<p>
'Sick?  No!' he retorted; but made no attempt to
move.  'Dead, more like! and catching my first glimpse
of paradise.'
</p>

<p>
'Fie, Messire!' she exclaimed gaily.  'To make so
sure of going speedily to Heaven!'
</p>

<p>
'How can I help being sure when angels are present to
confirm my belief?'
</p>

<p>
'But you are not in Heaven,' she assured him, and smiled
on him archly from out a frame of tender, leafless branches.
'You are in an arbour in the park, whither I and two of
my servants brought you when you fell into our arms at
the postern gate.'
</p>

<p>
He raised himself upon his elbow, found he could do it
without much pain; then looked about him searchingly
and wonderingly.  He was lying on a couch and his head
had apparently been resting on a couple of velvet cushions.
All around him the still dormant tendrils of wild clematis
wound in and out of skilfully constructed woodwork.
Overhead, the woodwork was shaped to a dome, and straight
in front of him there stretched out a vista over the park
of a straight, grass walk, bordered with beds of brilliantly
coloured tulips and hyacinths and backed by a row of
young limes, on which the baby leaves gleamed like pale
emeralds, whilst far away the graceful pinnacles of the
cathedral stood out like perfect lace-work against the vivid
blue of the sky.
</p>

<p>
'Well, Messire,' resumed Jacqueline lightly, after awhile,
'are you convinced now that you are still on earth, and
that it was by human agency that you arrived here, not on
angels' wings?'
</p>

<p>
'No, I am not convinced of that, Madame,' he replied.
'At the same time, I would dearly like to know how I did
come here.'
</p>

<p>
'Simply enough, Messire.  I was taking my usual walk
in the park, when I heard an awful commotion on the other
side of the wall.  I and my two servants who were with me
hurried to the postern gate, for of a truth the cries that
we heard sounded threatening and ominous.  One of my
servants climbed over the shoulders of the other and hoisted
himself to the top of the wall, from whence he saw that a
whole crowd armed with knives and sticks was furiously
attacking a single man, who was standing his ground with
his back against the postern gate, whilst we could all hear
quite distinctly the clash of missiles hurled against the wall.
To pull open the gate was the work of a few seconds, and
you, Messire, fell backwards into my&mdash;into my servants' arms.'
</p>

<p>
Then, as he made no sign, said not a word, only remained
quite still&mdash;almost inert&mdash;resting on his elbow and gazing
on her with eyes filled with passionate soul-hunger, she
added gently:
</p>

<p>
'You are not in pain, Messire?'
</p>

<p>
'In sore pain, ma donna,' he replied with a sigh.  'In
incurable pain, I fear me.'
</p>

<p>
The tone of his voice, the look in his eyes while he said
this, made it impossible for her not to understand.  She
lowered her eyes for a moment, for his glance had brought
a hot blush to her cheeks.  There was a moment of tense
silence in the little arbour&mdash;a silence broken only by the
murmur of the breeze through the young twigs of the wild
clematis and the call of a robin in the branches of the limes.
Jacqueline was the first to rouse herself from this strange
and sweet oppression.  She gave a quick little sigh and,
unable to speak, she was turning to go away, flying as if
by instinct from some insidious danger which seemed to
lurk for her in the wild, tremulous beating of her heart.
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline!'
</p>

<p>
She had not thought that her name could sound so sweet
as it did just then, when it came to her in a fervent,
passionate appeal from the depths of the fragrant arbour, where
awhile ago she and her servants had laid Messire down to
rest.  She did not turn her head to look on him now, but
nevertheless paused on the threshold, for her heart was
beating so fast that she felt almost choked, and her knees
shook so that she was forced to cling with one hand to the
curtain of young twigs which hung at the entrance of the
arbour.
</p>

<p>
The next moment he was by her side.  She felt that he
was near her, even though she still kept her head resolutely
turned away.  He put one knee to the ground and, stooping,
kissed the hem of her gown.  And Jacqueline&mdash;a mere
child where knowledge of the great passion is concerned&mdash;felt
that something very great and very mysterious, as
well as very beautiful, had suddenly been revealed to her
by this simple act of homage performed by this one man.
She realized all of a sudden why those few weeks ago, when
the mysterious singer with the mellow voice had sung beneath
her window, the whole world had seemed to her full of beauty
and of joy, why during these past long and weary days while
Messire lay sick and she could not see him, that self-same
world became unspeakably drab and ugly.  She knew now
that, with his song, the singer had opened the portals of
her heart, and that, unknown to herself, she had let Love
creep in there and make himself a nest, from whence he had
alternately tortured her or made her exquisitely happy.
Tears which seared and soothed rose to her eyes; a stupendous
longing for something which she could not quite grasp,
filled her entire soul.  And with it all, an infinite sadness
made her heart ache till she could have called out with
the pain of it&mdash;a sense of the unattainable, of something
perfect and wonderful, which by a hideous caprice of Fate
must for ever remain out of her reach.
</p>

<p>
'It can never be, Messire!' was all that she said.  The
words came like a cry, straight from her heart&mdash;a child's
heart, that has not yet learned to dissemble.  And that cry
spoke more certainly and more tangibly than any avowal
could have done.  In a moment, Gilles was on his feet,
his arms were round her shoulders and his face was buried
in her fragrant hair.  And she, unresisting, yielded herself
to him, savoured the sweetness of his caresses, the touch
of his lips on her eyes, her cheeks, her mouth.  Her ardent
nature, long held in fetters by convention, responded with
all its richness to the insistent call of the man's passionate
love.
</p>

<p>
'You love me, Jacqueline?' he asked, and looked down
into the depths of those exquisite blue eyes which had
captured his soul long ago and made him their slave until
this hour, when they in their turn yielded entirely to him.
</p>

<p>
'Verily,' she replied quaintly, and looked shyly into his
glowing face; 'I do believe, in truth, Messire, that I do.'
</p>

<p>
Let those who can, blame Gilles de Crohin for losing his
head after that, and for promptly forgetting everything
that he ought to have remembered, save the rapture of
holding her to his breast.  Of a truth, duty, honour,
promises, the Duc d'Anjou and Madame la Reyne, were as
far from his ken just now as is a crawling worm from the
starry firmament above.  He was going away to-day&mdash;out,
out into a great world, into the unknown, where life could
be made anew, where there would be neither sorrow nor
tears, if he could carry this exquisite woman thither in his
arms.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot let you go, ma donna,' he murmured as he held
her closer and ever closer, and covered her lips, her neck,
her throat with kisses.  'No power on earth can take you
from me now that I have you, that I hold you, my beautiful,
exquisite flower.  You love me, Jacqueline?' he asked
her for the tenth time, and for the tenth time she murmured
in response: 'I love you!'
</p>

<p>
Time had ceased to be.  The world no longer existed
for these two happy beings who had found one another.
There was only Love for them&mdash;Love, pure and holy, and
Passion, that makes the world go round.  There was spring
in the air, and the scent of awakening life around them,
the fragrance of budding blossom, the call of birds, the hum
of bees&mdash;Nature, exquisite, wonderful in her perfect selfishness,
and in her oblivion of all save her own immutable
Self.
</p>

<p>
'You love me, Jacqueline?'
</p>

<p>
'I love you!'
</p>

<p>
'Then, in the name of God that made us to love one
another,' he entreated with ever-growing fervour, 'let us
forget everything, leave everything, dare all for the sake
of our Love.  It can never be, you say ... everything
can be, mignonne; for Love makes everything possible.
Rank, wealth, duty, country, King&mdash;what are they but
shadows?  Leave them, my flower!  Leave them and come
to me!  Love is true, love is real!  Come with me, Jacqueline,
and by the living God who made you as perfect as you
are, by your heavenly blue eyes and your maddening smile,
I swear to you that I will give you such an infinity of worship
that I will make of your life one long, unceasing rapture.'
</p>

<p>
She had closed her eyes, drinking in his ardour with her
very soul.  Hers was one of those super-natures which,
when they give, do so in the fullest measure.  Being a
woman, and one nurtured in self-control and acute sensitiveness,
she did not, even at this blissful moment, lose complete
grasp of herself; unlike the man, her passion did not carry
her entirely into the realm of forgetfulness.  She yielded
to his kisses, knowing that, as they were the first, so they
would be the last that she would ever savour in the fullness
of perfect ecstasy; that parting&mdash;dreary, inevitable,
woeful parting&mdash;must follow this present transient happiness.
Yet, knowing all that, she would not forgo the exquisite
joy that she felt in yielding, the exquisite joy, too, that
she was giving him.  She deliberately plucked the rich
fruit of delight, even though she knew that inexorable Fate
would wrench it from her even before she had tasted its
sweetness to the full.
</p>

<p>
It was only when Jacqueline, suddenly waking as from
a dream and disengaging herself gently from his arms,
said once again, more resolutely this time: 'It can never
be, Messire!' that Gilles in his turn realized what he had
done.  He was brought back to earth with one of those
sudden blows of reawakened consciousness which leave a
man stunned and bruised, in a state of quasi-hebetude.
For one supreme moment of his life the gates of an earthly
paradise had been opened for him and he had been granted
a peep into such radiant possibilities that, dazzled and giddy
with joy, he had felt within himself that sublime arrogance
which makes light of every obstacle and is ready to ride
rough-shod over the entire world.
</p>

<p>
But the inexorable 'It can never be!' had struck at
the portals of his consciousness, and even before he had
become fully sentient he saw the grim hand of Fate closing
those golden gates before his eyes, and pointing sternly to
the path which led down to earth, left him once more alone
with his dream.
</p>

<p>
'It can never be!'
</p>

<p>
He tried to wrestle with Fate, to wrest from cruel hands
that happiness which already was slipping from his grasp.
</p>

<p>
'Why not?' he cried out defiantly.  Then, in a final,
agonized entreaty, he murmured once more, 'Why not?'
</p>

<p>
Ah! he knew well enough why not!  Fool and criminal,
to have forgotten it even for this one brief instant of perfect
bliss!  Why not?  Ye gods, were there not a thousand
reasons why a penniless soldier of fortune should not dare
approach a noble and rich heiress? and a thousand others
why he&mdash;Gilles de Crohin&mdash;should never have spoken one
word of love to this one woman, who was destined for another
man&mdash;and that man his own liege lord.  There was a
gateless barrier made up of honour and chivalry and of an oath
sworn upon the cross between his love and Jacqueline de
Broyart, which in honour he should never have attempted
to cross.
</p>

<p>
Consciousness came back to him with a sudden rush,
not only the consciousness of what he had done, but of
what he had now to do.  Not all the bitter tears of lifelong
remorse would ever succeed in wiping out the past; but
honour demanded that at least the future be kept unsullied.
</p>

<p>
A final struggle with temptation that was proving
overwhelming, a final, wholly human, longing to keep and to
hold this glorious gift of God; then the last renunciation
as he allowed the loved one to glide out of his arms like a
graceful bird, still a-quiver after this brief immersion in
the torrential wave of his passion.  Then, as she stood now
a few paces away from him, with wide, sad eyes deliberately
turned to gaze on the distant sky, he passed his hand across
his forehead, as if with the firm will to clear his brain and
chase away the last vestige of the sweet, insistent dream.
</p>

<p>
Once more there was silence in the fragrant arbour;
but it was the silence of unspoken sorrow&mdash;a silence laden
with the portent of an approaching farewell.  Gilles was
the first to break it.
</p>

<p>
'It can never be, ma donna,' he said quietly, his rugged
voice still shaking with emotion, now resolutely held in
bondage.  'I know that well enough.  Knew it even at
the moment when, in my folly, I first dared to kiss your gown.'
</p>

<p>
'I was as much to blame as you, Messire,' she said naïvely,
her lips trembling with suppressed sobs.  'I don't know
how it came about, but...'
</p>

<p>
'It came about, ma donna,' he rejoined fervently, 'because
you are as perfect as the angels, and God when He fashioned
you allowed no human weakness to mar His adorable work.
The avowal which came from your sweet lips was just like
the manna which He gave to the hungry crowd.  I, the
poor soldier of fortune, have been made thereby more
enviable than a king.'
</p>

<p>
'And yet we must part, Messire?' she said firmly, and
withal in her voice that touching note of childlike appeal
which for the unfortunate dweller on the outskirts of
paradise was more difficult to withstand than were a glass of
water to one dying of thirst.  'I do not belong to myself,
you know,' she continued, and looked him once more serenely
in the face.  'Ever since my dear brother died I have been
made to understand that my future, my person, belong
to my country&mdash;my poor, sorrowing country, who, it seems,
hath sore need of me.  I have no right to love, no right to
think of mine own happiness.  God alone in His Omniscience
knows how you came to fill my heart, Messire, to the
exclusion of every other thought, of every other duty.  It was
wrong of me, I know&mdash;wrong and unmaidenly.  But the
secret of my love would for ever have remained locked
in my heart if I had not learned that you loved me too.'
</p>

<p>
She made her profession of faith so firmly and earnestly
and with such touching innocence that the hot passion
which a while ago was raging in Gilles' heart was suddenly
soothed and purified as if with the touch of a divine breath.
A wonderful peace descended on his soul: he hardly knew
himself, his own turbulent temper, his untamed and
passionate nature, so calm and serene did he suddenly feel.
'Yes, we must part, ma donna,' he said, in a simple,
monotonous voice which he himself scarcely recognized
as his own.  'We must each go our way; you to fulfil
the great destiny for which God has created you and to
which your sorrowing country calls you; I to watch from
afar the course of your fortunes, like the poor, starving
astrologer doth watch the course of the stars.'
</p>

<p>
'From afar?' she said, and her delicate cheeks took on
a dull, lifeless hue.  'Then you will go away?'
</p>

<p>
'To-day, please God!' he replied.
</p>

<p>
'But, I&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You, ma donna, my beautiful Flower o' the Lily, you
will, I pray Heaven, forget me even as the young, living
sapling forgets the stricken bough which the tempests have
laid low.'
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
'I will never forget you, Messire.  If you go from me
to-day I will never know another happy hour again.'
</p>

<p>
'May God bless you for saying this!  But I have no
fear that you will not be happy.  Happiness comes as
readily to your call as does a bird to its mate.  You and
happiness are one, ma donna.  Where you are, all the joys
of earth dwell and flourish.'
</p>

<p>
'Not when I am alone,' she said, the hot tears welling
to her eyes, her voice shaken with sobs.  'And thoughts
of you&mdash;lonely and desolate&mdash;will chase all joy from out
my life.'
</p>

<p>
'But you must not think of me at all, ma donna,' he
rejoined with infinite tenderness.  'And when you do,
when a swift remembrance of the poor, rough soldier doth
perchance disturb the serenity of your dreams, do not
think of him as either lonely or desolate.  I shall never
again in life be lonely&mdash;never again be desolate.  I am now
rich beyond the dreams of men, rich with the boundless
wealth of unforgettable memories.'
</p>

<p>
'You talk so readily of forgetting,' she said sadly.  'Will
you find it so easy, Messire?'
</p>

<p>
'Look at me, ma donna, and read the answer to your
question in mine eyes.'
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him, with that shy and demure glance
which rendered her so adorable and so winning, and in his
face she saw so much misery, such unspeakable sorrow that
her heart was seized with a terrible ache.  The sobs which
were choking her could no longer be suppressed.  She stuffed
her tiny handkerchief into her mouth to stop herself from
crying out aloud, and feeling giddy and faint, she sank on
to a pile of cushions close by and buried her face in her
hands, letting her tears flow freely at last, since she was
not ashamed of the intensity of her grief.
</p>

<p>
Gilles could have dashed his head against the nearest
tree-trunk, so enraged was he with himself, so humiliated
at his own weakness.  How deeply did he regret now that
de Landas' sword had not ended his miserable life, before
he had brought sorrow and tears to this woman whom he
worshipped.  What right had he to disturb her peace of
mind?  What right to stir to the very depths of her fine
nature those strong passions which, but for his clumsy
touch, might for ever have remained dormant?
</p>

<p>
And through it all was the sense of his own baseness,
which had come upon him with a rush&mdash;his treachery to
Madame la Reyne, his falseness to his sworn oath.  Love
for this beautiful woman had swept him off his feet, caught
him at a weak and unguarded moment and left him now
covered with humiliation and self-reproach, an object of
hatred to himself, for ever in future to be haunted by the
recurrent vision of the loved one's face bathed in tears and
by the sound of those harrowing sobs which would until
the end of time rend his soul with unutterable anguish.
</p>

<p>
'Would to God we had never met!' he murmured
fervently.
</p>

<p>
And she had sufficient courage, sufficient strength, to
smile up at him through her tears, murmuring with
enchanting simplicity:
</p>

<p>
'Would to God we had not to part.'
</p>

<p>
What else could he do but fall on his knees in mute
adoration, and with the final, heartbroken farewell dying
upon his lips?  He stooped low until his head nearly touched
the ground.  Her small foot in its velvet shoe peeped just
beneath the hem of her gown, and with a last act of humble
adoration, he pressed his lips upon its tip.
</p>

<p>
'Farewell, my adored one,' he said softly, as he straightened
out his tall, massive figure once more.  'With my
heart and my soul I worship you now and for all time.
Even though I may never again look upon your loveliness,
the memory of it will haunt me until the hour of death,
when my spirit&mdash;free to roam the universe&mdash;will fly to
you as surely as doth the swallow to its mate.  And if in
the future,' he added with solemn earnestness, 'aught
should occur to render me odious in your sight, then I pray
you on bended knees and in the name of this past
unforgettable hour, to remember that, whatever else I may have
done that was unworthy and base, my love for you has
been as pure and sacred as is the love of the lark for the
sun.'
</p>

<p>
And, before she could reply, he was gone.  She watched
his tall figure striding rapidly away along the grass walk,
until he became a mere speck upon the shimmering distance
beyond.  Soon he disappeared from view altogether, and

CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
WHAT JACQUELINE WAS FORCED TO HEAR
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Indeed, to Jacqueline, even more so than to her lover,
this last half-hour appeared more unreal than a dream.
For a long time after Gilles had gone she remained sitting
on the pile of cushions at the entrance of the arbour, gazing,
gazing far away into the translucent sky, struggling with
that life-problem which to the ingenuous hath so oft
remained unsolved: If God gave me that happiness, why
did He take it away again so soon?
</p>

<p>
Life appeared before her now as one long vista of
uninterrupted dreariness.  With her heart dead within her,
she would in truth become the pawn in political games
which her guardian had always desired that she should be.
Well! no doubt it was all for the best.  Awhile ago, ere
she had met Messire, ere he had taught her to read in the
great Book of Love, she had been headstrong and rebellious.
A loveless marriage of convention, a mere political alliance
would have revolted her and mayhap caused grave
complications in her troubled country's affairs.  Now, nothing
mattered.  Nothing would ever matter again.  Since happiness
was for ever denied her, she was far more ready to
sacrifice her personal feelings to her country's needs than
she had been before.
</p>

<p>
Her joy in life would for the future be made up of sacrifice,
and if she could do her beloved and sorely-stricken country
a permanent benefit thereby, well! she would feel once
more that she had not lived her life in vain.
</p>

<p>
At this stage she was not actively unhappy.  Emotion
had torn at her heartstrings and left her bruised and sore,
but her happiness had been too brief to cause bitter regret.
She was chiefly conscious of an immense feeling of pity
for her lover, whose heartache must indeed be as great as
her own.  But, for herself, there was nothing that she
regretted, nothing that she would have wished to be
otherwise.  All her memories of him were happy ones&mdash;except
that moment of the midnight quarrel in the Palace, when
for a brief while she had wilfully misjudged him.  Even the
final parting from him, though it broke her heart, had
been wholly free from bitterness.  She was so sure of his
love that she could almost bear patiently to see him go
away, knowing that she could always treasure his love in
her heart as something pure and almost holy.
</p>

<p>
All through life that love would encompass her, would
keep her from evil thoughts and evil intent, whilst nothing
on earth could rob her of the sweets of memory.  She loved
him and he had wanted her, even long before she knew him;
he had come to Cambray in disguise, under a mask, and had
wooed her in his own romantic fashion, with song and laughter
and joy of living, so different to the amorous sighs and
languorous looks wherewith other swains had striven to
win her regard.  She loved the mystery wherewith he had
surrounded his person, smiled at the thought how he had led
Monseigneur her guardian by the nose, and had tried vainly
to hoodwink even her&mdash;her, Jacqueline, who had loved him
already that night when he had flung Pierre over the wall
and run to her window, singing: 'Mignonne, venez voir
si la rose&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
And he had thought to hoodwink her after that! thought
to throw dust in her eyes by playing a dual rôle, now
masquerading as the Prince de Froidmont, now as the equerry&mdash;he,
the chosen of her heart, the man whose every action,
every word was fine and noble and dear....  How foolish
of him to imagine that she could be deceived.  Why, there
was that scar upon his hand&mdash;a scar the sight of which had
loosened a perfect floodgate of memories&mdash;a scar which she
herself had helped to tend and bind three years ago, in the
monastery of Gembloux.  She could even remember the
leech saying at the time: 'The rascal will be marked for
life, I warrant.  I've never seen such a strange wound before&mdash;the
exact shape of a cross it is, like the mark on an ass's
back.'
</p>

<p>
How well she remembered that night!  Her own anxiety
for the wounded man&mdash;a poor soldier, evidently, for he was
miserably clad; his clothes were old and had been frequently
darned and his pockets only contained a few sols.  He had
apparently fought with the French on that awful day,
and had been discovered by herself, lying unconscious near
the monastery wall, up on the hill, more than a league away
from the field of battle.  She remembered insisting that
the leech should tend him, and afterwards that he should
be taken back to the spot where the fighting had taken place,
in case some friend or comrade be searching for him.  After
that, the death of her dear brother and the change in her
fortunes had chased all other memories away, until that
awful night in the Palace, when de Landas had behaved
like a coward and she like a vixen, and the Prince de
Froidmont had threaded the masks of his vanquished enemies
upon his sword and thrown them at her feet.  She had seen
the scar then upon his hand, and the sight had troubled
her, because of the mystery which it evoked.  Then came
the next day, when she sat in the window embrasure in
wait for the Prince's equerry.  At once his face had seemed
so strangely familiar to her&mdash;and then there was the scar!
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline remembered how deeply she pondered over
the puzzle then.  The Prince de Froidmont and his equerry
were one and the same person; that was evident, of course.
And both these personalities were also merged in that of the
poor soldier whom she had helped to tend in the monastery
of Gembloux.  But, unlike most women, she had never
tried to pry into his secrets.  Somehow the mystery&mdash;if
mystery there was&mdash;seemed to harmonize with his whole
personality.  She loved him as he was&mdash;rough at times,
at others infinitely gentle; and oh! the strength of his
love and its ardour when he held her in his arms!  She
would be quite satisfied if the mystery remained for ever
unsolved.  It was a part of him, not by any means the
least amongst his many attractions in her sight.
</p>

<p>
Now he had gone, never to return, leaving her alone with
only memory for company&mdash;memory and a huge longing
to rest once more in the safe fold of his protecting arms.
</p>

<p>
'Come back to me, Messire!' she called out to him in
her heart.  'Take no heed of what I said when in my blind
folly I vowed that it could never be.  It shall and must be
if you'll only come back to me&mdash;just once&mdash;only once&mdash;and
I should be content.  God never meant that you and I
should part before we had each drained the cup of Love
to the end.  The world is ours, our Love shall conquer it.
Not the world of riches and of pomp; not even the world
of glory.  Just a little kingdom of our own, wherein no one
shall dwell but you and I&mdash;a little kingdom bound for me
by the span of your arms, my throne your heart, my crown
your kiss.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Dreaming, sighing, longing, Jacqueline sat on in the
arbour, unmindful of time.  It was only when the cathedral
bell boomed the midday hour that she awoke&mdash;vaguely,
still&mdash;to the actualities of life.  Of a truth, it seemed
difficult to conceive that life in the future must go on just
the same: the daily rounds, the conventionalities, the
social flummeries must all go on, and she&mdash;Jacqueline&mdash;would
have to smile, to speak, to live on&mdash;just the same.
</p>

<p>
And yet nothing, nothing on earth could ever be quite
the same again.  It is impossible to delve deeply into the
Book of Passion, to have mastered the lesson which God
Himself forbade His children to learn, and then to look on
Life with the same vacant, ignorant eyes as before.  The
daily rounds would certainly go on; but life itself would
henceforth be different.  The girl&mdash;a mere child&mdash;had in
one brief half-hour become a woman.  Love had
transfigured the world for her.
</p>

<p>
But she tried to think of life as he&mdash;her knight&mdash;would
have wished her to do, to fulfil her destiny so that from
afar he might be proud of her.  Above all, she would show
a serene face to her world.  Her fellow-citizens here in
Cambray had quite enough sorrow to behold, without
having the sight of Madame Jacqueline de Broyart's
tear-stained face constantly before them.  There would be much
to do in the near future&mdash;much grief to console, many
troubles to alleviate.  What was one solitary heartache
beside the sufferings of an entire nation?
</p>

<p>
She rose to her feet, feeling more valiant and strong.
One last look she gave round the little arbour which had
sheltered her short-lived happiness.  The pale sun peeped
in shyly through the interstices of the woodwork, and threw
a shaft of honey-coloured light upon the couch where he
had lain unconscious, after she and her servants had saved
him from the mob.  With an impulsive movement which
she did not try to check, she ran up to the couch, and,
kneeling down beside it, she buried her face in the pillows
whereon his head had rested.  A few more tears, one
long convulsive sob, a heart-broken sigh; then nothing
more.  That was the end! the last word in the final chapter
of her romance, the lifelong farewell to her girlish dream.
</p>

<p>
Then she dried her eyes resolutely, rose to her feet, and
prepared to return to the Palace.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
But at the entrance of the arbour she was met by de
Landas.  He was standing there, looking at her, with a
hideously evil sneer upon his face.
</p>

<p>
She had not spoken with him since that day when she
had for ever cast him out of her heart, had always succeeded
in avoiding him when the exigencies of their mutual social
position forced her to be in the same room with him.  To-day
she felt as if his very presence was an outrage.  How long
he had been there she could not say; how much of her
soul agony he had witnessed caused her a sense of
intolerable humiliation.  For the moment he had trapped her,
obviously had lain in wait for her, and was not like to let
her go without forcing his company upon her.  There was no
other exit to the little arbour, and she, unable to avoid him,
yet loathing the very sight of him, could only take refuge
in an attitude of haughty indifference and of lofty scorn.
</p>

<p>
'I will not pollute you with my touch,' he said coolly,
seeing that at sight of him she had retreated a step or two,
as she would have done had she encountered a noisome
reptile.  He remained standing in the doorway, leaning
against the woodwork, with arms folded and legs crossed
and an insolent leer in his dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Then I pray you to let me pass,' was her calm rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
'Not,' he riposted, 'till you have allowed me to say
something to you, which hath weighed on my heart these past
three weeks.'
</p>

<p>
'There is nothing that you can wish to say to me,
M. le Marquis, that I would care to hear.'
</p>

<p>
'You are severe, Jacqueline,' he said.  Then, as she made
no reply save an indifferent shrug of the shoulders, he
added with well-feigned humility: 'Not more so than I
deserve, I know.  But I was delirious on that day.  I did
not know what I was saying.  Jealousy had completely
obscured my brain.  You would not make a madman
responsible for his ravings!'
</p>

<p>
'Let us leave it at that, M. le Marquis,' she rejoined
calmly.  'But you will understand that I do not care to
listen to that same madman's ravings again.'
</p>

<p>
'How cold you are!' he murmured, sighed dolefully
like one in utter grief.  His whole attitude suddenly
betokened contrition and overwhelming sentiment; his fine
dark eyes even contrived to fill themselves with tears.
'Have you forgotten so soon, Jacqueline?' he asked, 'all
that you and I have meant to one another in the past; how
oft your golden head hath rested against my heart!'
</p>

<p>
But she was not like to be taken in by this mood, the
falseness of which was transparent enough.
</p>

<p>
'An' you do not cease to insult me with your ramblings,'
she said, with all the scorn which his contemptible ruse
deserved, 'I will call to my servants to rid me of your
presence.'
</p>

<p>
'Your servants are too far away to hear you,' he retorted
with a cynical laugh.  'And if you do not listen to me
to-day, Jacqueline, you will put it out of my power to save
you from humiliation and your lover from death.'
</p>

<p>
'How dare you!' she exclaimed aloud, roused at last
out of her indifference by his wanton insolence.  Whereupon
he, seeing that she was not to be won by honeyed words,
threw down the mask in an instant, appeared in his true
colours&mdash;false, vengeful and full of venom, his face distorted
by jealous rage, breathing greed and spite as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' he said with a sneer.  'A man who has been
flouted and scorned and who sees a hated rival assuming
a position which once was his, is not like to mince his
words.  I have nothing to lose at your hands&mdash;remember
that, my fine Madame.  The full measure of your hate
and of your scorn are my portion now, it seems; while
Messire le Prince de Froidmont is the recipient of your
smiles.'
</p>

<p>
Outraged to her innermost being by hearing that name,
which to her was almost sacred, profaned by that vile
creature's lips, Jacqueline would readily now have forgotten
her dignity, and fled from his presence if she could, as she
would from that of a spirit of evil.  But he divined her
wish to flee, feared that she might succeed in slipping past
him; so he seized her by the wrist just as she meditated
a dash past him, and held her so fast and with such a
brutish grip, that but for her courage and sense of dignity,
she could have screamed with pain.
</p>

<p>
'Listen to me, Jacqueline,' he said menacingly.  'You
must listen!  Think you I will stand by any longer and
see the man whom I hate worse than any man I have ever
hated in all my life before, in the full enjoyment of what I
have lost&mdash;of your fortune, my winsome Flemish scrub,
the only thing about you which is worth a Spanish
gentleman's while to covet?  Oh! but I know more about
your love intrigue, my proud lady, than you think!  I knew
something of it before to-day, when, half an hour ago I
saw the noble Prince de Froidmont stealing unmasked out
of the postern gate.  Unmasked, my tricksy lady,' he
continued with a harsh laugh, 'in more senses than one; for
though he was dressed in the rich clothes affected by the
master, the man who stole out of the postern gate had the
features of the equerry.  A pretty story, indeed, this would
make for Monseigneur the governor!  Madame Jacqueline
de Broyart meeting clandestinely, like a flirtatious kitchen
wench, some nameless adventurer who hath captured her
fancy!'
</p>

<p>
'M. de Landas,' she said quite calmly, as soon as he gave
her a chance of making herself heard, 'an you have a
spark of manhood left in you, you will cease these insults
and let me go.'
</p>

<p>
'What else was it but a clandestine meeting?' he riposted
savagely.  'Your flaming cheeks and tear-filled eyes
proclaim it loudly enough.  I saw him, I tell you; then I
searched for you, but I did not know of this arbour.  Such
private trysting-places were never granted me!'
</p>

<p>
'M. de Landas,' she reiterated for the third time, 'I
desire you to be silent and to let me go.'
</p>

<p>
'So you shall, my dear,' he riposted with his insolent
leer.  'So you shall!  You shall be free in a moment or
two&mdash;free to go quietly back to your own room and there
to ponder over one or two questions which I am going to
put to you, and which mayhap have never occurred to you
before.  Who is this Prince de Froidmont?  Where did
he spring from?  Why does he masquerade, now as the
master, anon as his own equerry?  What unavowable secret
doth he hide beneath that eternal mask of his?  Can you
answer that, my specious lady, who are still fresh from
that enigmatic person's arms?  Was it the Prince who
kissed you in this arbour, or was it his servant?'
</p>

<p>
Then, as she drew herself up to her full height, looking
a veritable statue of lofty disdain, a world of withering
contumely in her fine eyes, he went on more insidiously:
</p>

<p>
'Let me tell you one thing, Jacqueline, of which you
obviously are ignorant.  There is no Prince de Froidmont
inscribed in France's book of Heraldry.  There is an
out-at-elbows Seigneur de Froidmont, whose fortunes are at
so low an ebb that he sells his sword to the highest bidder.
He was last seen in the company of the Duc d'Anjou, the
most dissolute scion of an abandoned race.  And those
who knew him then, say that he is tall and broad-shouldered,
hath a martial mien and the air of a soldier.  They also
say that he has a curiously shaped scar on the back of
his hand.  Now, I warn you, Jacqueline, that when next I
meet Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont, I shall ask him
to give me his hand in friendship, and if he refuses, which
he certainly will do, I shall challenge him to take off his
glove ere I smite him in his lying face with mine.'
</p>

<p>
'When you have finished with those vile calumnies,
Messire...' began Jacqueline coldly.
</p>

<p>
'Calumnies!' he exclaimed.  'Calumnies, you call
them?  Then Heaven help you, for your infatuation has
indeed made you blind!  But take care, Jacqueline, take
care!  The eyes of hate are keener than those of
love.'
</p>

<p>
'The eyes of some miserable informant, you mean!'
she retorted.
</p>

<p>
'Informant?  I had no need of an informant to tell
me that if a man shuns the gaze of his fellow-creatures it
is because he hath something unavowable to hide.  Beware
the man who conceals his face behind a mask, his identity
behind an assumed name!  He has that to conceal which
is dishonourable and base.  Think on it all, Jacqueline.
'Tis a friendly warning I am giving you.  The path which
you have chosen can only lead to humiliation.  Already
the people of Cambray are enraged against the mysterious
stranger.  Take care lest Madame Jacqueline de Broyart,
duchesse et princesse de Ramèse, be found bestowing her
favours upon a common spy!'
</p>

<p>
He released her wrist, having had his say, felt triumphant
and elated too because she had been forced, in spite of
herself, to listen to him.  Hers was an intensely mobile
face, with sensitive brow and lips that readily betrayed her
thoughts and emotions; and, as he had said very
pertinently, the eyes of hate are sharper than those of love.
He had studied her face while he was pouring the pernicious
poison into her ear.  He saw that poison filtrating slowly
but surely into her brain.  For the moment she looked
scornful, aloof, dignified; <i>but she had listened</i>; she had
not called to her servants; she had not even made a second
attempt to escape.  Eve once listened to the smooth
persuasion of the serpent; Elsa heard to the end what Ortrude
had to say, and Jacqueline de Broyart, her soul still
vibrating in response to Gilles de Crohin's passionate love, had
not closed her ears to de Landas' perfidy.
</p>

<p>
The serpent, having shed his venom, was content.  He
was subtle enough not to spoil the effect of his rhetoric
by any further words.  Obviously Jacqueline no longer
heard him.  Her thoughts were already far away, wandering
mayhap in those labyrinthine regions to which a
miscreant's blind hatred had led them.  He turned on his
heel and left her standing there, still dignified and scornful.
But there was that in her pose, in the glitter of her eyes
and the set of her lips, which suggested that something of
her former serenity had gone.  She still looked calm and
indifferent, but her quietude now was obviously forced;
there was a tell-tale quiver round her lips, the sight of which
gave de Landas infinite satisfaction.  In her whole person
there was still determination, valour and perfect faith;
but it was militant faith, the courage and trust of a woman
fighting in defence of her love&mdash;not the sweet tenderness
of childlike belief.
</p>

<p>
And with an inward sigh of content, the serpent wriggled
quietly away.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
HOW MORE THAN ONE PLOT WAS HATCHED
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
And now the die was cast.
</p>

<p>
Gilles de Crohin stood before Monseigneur the
governor of Cambray and Monsieur le Comte de Lalain
in the library of the Archiepiscopal Palace, and in the name
of Monsieur Duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon, asked for the hand
of Madame Jacqueline de Broyart in marriage.
</p>

<p>
It was a solemn hour wherein the fate of nations rested
in the hand of men, whilst God withheld His final decree.
Gilles had kept his word to the end.  Madame la Reyne
could be satisfied.  He had put resolutely behind him all
thoughts of his dream and of his own happiness.  His
exquisite Jacqueline had ceased to be aught but a vision
of loveliness, intangible, and for him&mdash;the poor soldier of
fortune&mdash;for ever unattainable.  For once in his life he
was thankful for the beneficence of the mask.  At least he
was spared the effort of concealing the ravages which misery
had wrought upon his face.  What the final struggle had
cost him, no one would ever know; even Maître Jehan
had been shut out from the narrow room, wherein a man's
imprisoned soul fought out the grim fight 'twixt love and
duty.
</p>

<p>
When, an hour later, Messire called to his faithful henchman
to help him don his richest attire, the battle had been
won.  The man himself was left heart-broken and bruised,
a mere wreck of his former light-hearted self; but honour
and the sworn word had gained the day.  Love lay fettered,
passion vanquished.  God's will alone should now be done.
</p>

<p>
A great sigh of relief came from d'Inchy when <i>Monsieur</i>
had pronounced the final word which bound him irrevocably
to the destinies of Flanders.  He and de Lalain bowed their
heads almost to the ground.  Gilles extended his hand to
them both and they each kissed it almost reverently.
</p>

<p>
Then they both rose, and d'Inchy said solemnly:
</p>

<p>
'No Prince could wear a more glorious crown than that
of the Sovereignty of the Netherlands.'
</p>

<p>
And de Lalain added with equal earnestness:
</p>

<p>
'And no King could wed a worthier mate.'
</p>

<p>
A worthier mate!  Ye gods!  Gilles could have laughed
aloud at the abjectness of this tragic farce.  A worthier
mate?  Who knew that better than the unfortunate man
who had held her for one brief, blissful moment in his
arms, just long enough to feel how perfect, how exquisite
she was&mdash;just long enough to realize all that he had lost.
Truly hell's worst torture could not be more harrowing than
this.
</p>

<p>
Wearied to the very top of his bent, Messire did his best
to bring the interview to an end.
</p>

<p>
'And now, Messeigneurs,' he said at last, 'I will, by your
leave, bid you farewell.  My Maître de Camp, Messire de
Balagny, has, as you know, arrived in Cambray.  He will
represent me here the while I go to rejoin my armies.'
</p>

<p>
'Your Highness would leave us?' exclaimed d'Inchy
with a frown.  'So soon?'
</p>

<p>
'Only to return in triumph, Messire,' replied Gilles, 'at
the head of my armies, after I have brought the Spaniard
to his knees.'
</p>

<p>
'But Madame Jacqueline,' protested de Lalain.  'The
betrothal&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'While Cambray is starving, Messire, and the Duke of
Parma is at her gates, there is no time for public festivities.
You will convey to Madame Jacqueline de Broyart my earnest
desire that she should confer the supreme honour upon
me by consenting to be my wife.'  Then, as the two men
appeared wrapt in moody silence, he added quickly, with I
know not what faint ray of hope within his heart: 'You are
doubtful of her consent?'
</p>

<p>
'Doubtful?  Oh, no, Monseigneur,' replied d'Inchy.
'Jacqueline de Broyart is, above all, a daughter of Flanders.
She is ready to give her fortune, herself, all that is asked
of her, to the man who will free her country from its
oppressors.'
</p>

<p>
'Then the sooner I go ... and return to claim my bride,'
rejoined Gilles dryly, 'the better it will be for us all.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Monseigneur&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But what?'
</p>

<p>
'The people of Cambray will wish to see Your Highness
with Madame Jacqueline by your side&mdash;her hand in
yours&mdash;in token of an irrevocable pledge.'
</p>

<p>
'Starving people care little for such flummery, Messire.
They will prefer to see the sentimental ceremony when mine
armies have driven the foe from their city's gates.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, ça, Messeigneurs!' suddenly queried Gilles with
growing impatience.  'Do you, perchance, mistrust me?'
</p>

<p>
The protest which came from the two Flemish lords in
response to this suggestion was not perhaps as whole-hearted
as it might have been.  Gilles frowned beneath his mask.
Here was a complication which he had not foreseen.  He
could part from Jacqueline&mdash;yes!&mdash;he could tear her sweet
image from out his heart, since she could never become his.
He could play his part in the odious comedy to the end&mdash;but
only on the condition that he should not see her again
or attempt to carry through the deception which, in her
presence, would anyhow be foredoomed to failure.
</p>

<p>
A public betrothal!  A solemn presentation to the people,
with Jacqueline's hand in his own, her dear eyes having
found him out in the very first minute that they met again,
despite every mask, every disguise and every trickery!
Heavens above! but there was a limit to human endurance!
and Gilles had already reached it, when he envisaged his
beloved as the wife of another man&mdash;and that man wholly
unworthy of her.  Now he had come to the end of his
submission.  Honour and loyalty could go no further.
</p>

<p>
Of a truth, it seemed as if some impish Fate would upset,
at this eleventh hour, Madame la Reyne's perfectly laid
schemes.  The Flemish lords looked obstinate.  It seemed
to Gilles that while he himself had stood silent for the space
of a quick heart-beat, cogitating as to his next course of
action, a secret understanding had quickly passed between
the two men.
</p>

<p>
This in its turn had the effect of stiffening Gilles' temper.
He felt like a gambler now, whose final stake was in jeopardy.
</p>

<p>
'For my part, Messeigneurs,' he said with a clever
assumption of haughty insolence, 'I could not lend myself to a
public pageant at this hour.  His Majesty my brother
would not wish it.  When I enter Cambray as its conqueror
I will claim my promised bride&mdash;and not before.'
</p>

<p>
This final 'either&mdash;or' was a bold stroke, no doubt:
the losing gambler's last throw.  If the Flemings demurred,
all was lost.  Gilles, by an almost superhuman effort,
contrived to remain outwardly calm, keeping up that air
of supercilious carelessness which had all along kept the
Flemish lords on tenterhooks.  Obviously the tone had
aroused their ire, just as it had done many a time before,
and Gilles could see well enough that a final repudiation of
the whole bargain hovered on M. d'Inchy's lips.  But once
again the counsels of prudence prevailed; the implied 'take
it or leave it,' so insolently spoken by <i>Monsieur</i>, had the
effect of softening the two men's obstinacy.  Perhaps they
both felt that matters had anyhow gone too far, even for
a man of Monsieur's vacillating temperament to withdraw
from the bargain with a shred of honour.  Be that as it
may, when Gilles rejoined a moment or two later with
marked impatience: 'Which is it to be, Messire?  Is a
Prince of the House of Valois not to be trusted to keep his
word?' d'Inchy replied quite glibly:
</p>

<p>
'Oh, absolutely, Monseigneur!'
</p>

<p>
'Well, then?' queried Gilles blandly.
</p>

<p>
'There is nothing more to be said,' concluded de Lalain.
'And if your Highness really desires to leave us&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I do desire to rejoin my armies as soon as may be.'
</p>

<p>
'Then it shall be in accordance with Monseigneur's
wishes.  I will see that everything is made ready for the
safety and secrecy of your journey.'
</p>

<p>
'You are more than gracious, Messire,' said Gilles, who
had some difficulty in disguising the intense relief which he
felt.  'As you know, my Maître de Camp, Messire de
Balagny, is in Cambray now.  He will be my representative
during my brief absence.'
</p>

<p>
After that, little more was said.  Formal leave-taking
took up the last few minutes of this momentous interview.
Gilles had some difficulty in concealing his eagerness to get
away: a dozen times within those same few minutes he
was on the point of betraying himself, for indeed it seemed
ludicrous that the Duc d'Anjou should be quite so eager
to go.  However, the two Flemings were in a distinctly
conciliatory mood now.  They appeared to desire nothing
save the keeping of His Highness' good graces.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur will remember that Cambray is on the edge
of starvation!' said d'Inchy earnestly at the last.
</p>

<p>
'Give me three months, Messire,' rejoined Gilles lightly,
'and her joy-bells will be ringing for her deliverance.'
</p>

<p>
'For the entry of <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou, within her
walls?'
</p>

<p>
'And the betrothal of Madame Jacqueline de Broyart
to a Prince of the House of France.'
</p>

<p>
'A happy hour for the Netherlands, Monseigneur.'
</p>

<p>
'And a proud one for me, Messire,' concluded Gilles
solemnly.  'For the Prince of the House of France will
not lead his bride to the altar empty-handed.  The freedom
of the Netherlands will be her marriage-portion.'
</p>

<p>
'Amen to that,' said the Flemish lords fervently.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
They kissed the gracious hand which was extended to
them; they bent the knee and took leave of their exalted
guest with all the ceremonial due to his rank.
</p>

<p>
But the moment that Gilles had finally succeeded in
effecting his escape, and even before his firm footstep had
ceased to echo along the corridors of the Palace, a complete
change took place in the demeanour of these two noble
lords.
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur the governor drew inkhorn, pen and paper
close to him, with almost feverish haste; then he began to
write, letter after letter, while his friend watched him in
silence.  For over half an hour no sound was heard in tie
room save the ceaseless scratching of d'Inchy's pen upon
the paper.  Only when half a dozen letters were written
and each had been duly signed and sealed did de Lalain
make a remark.
</p>

<p>
'You are sending out orders for a holiday to-morrow?'
he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied d'Inchy.
</p>

<p>
'And orders to de Landas not to allow any one to leave
the city?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought so.  You do not trust our wily Prince?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' retorted the other curtly.  'Do you?'
</p>

<p>
Then, as de Lalain made no reply, since indeed that
reply was obvious, d'Inchy went on, in a quick, sharp tone
of command:
</p>

<p>
'Will you see the Chief Magistrate yourself, my good de
Lalain?  Explain to him just what we have in contemplation.
A reception in the Town Hall, the presence of the
Provosts of the city and of the Mayors of the several guilds;
the announcement of the betrothal to be read to the people
from the balcony.  The Provosts must see to it that there
is a large concourse of people upon the Grand' Place and
that the whole city is beflagged by ten o'clock in the
morning, and wears an air of general festivity.'
</p>

<p>
'It shall be done at once,' said de Lalain simply.
</p>

<p>
D'Inchy then rang the bell and summoned one of his
special messengers to his presence.  As soon as the man
appeared, he gave him one of the letters which he had just
written.
</p>

<p>
'This to Messire de Landas,' he commanded.  'And
see that he has it without delay.'
</p>

<p>
The man retired, and when d'Inchy was once more alone
with his friend, he added complacently:
</p>

<p>
'This will close the trap, methinks, on our wily fox.'
</p>

<p>
'So long as he doth tumble into it,' remarked de Lalain
dryly.
</p>

<p>
'He will!  He will!  You may be sure of that!  Imagine
him a few hours hence, ready for his journey and finding
every gate closed against him and the town garrison afoot.
I have warned de Landas of what was in the wind, and given
him an outline of my plans for to-morrow.  I can safely
trust him to see that no one leaves the city within the next
four and twenty hours, for I have made him personally
accountable to me if any suspected person should effect
an escape.  So our fine <i>Monsieur</i> will fume and rage, and
demand to see Monseigneur the governor.  The latter,
weary and sick, will have long ago retired to bed.  In the
morning he will still be sick and unable to attend to
business, until past ten o'clock, when quite unexpectedly he
will have given his exalted guest the slip and already be
engaged on important matters at the Town Hall.  Thither
<i>Monsieur</i> will repair at once&mdash;you may take your oath on
that&mdash;fretting to receive his safe-conduct and be out of
the city ere another twenty-four hours go by.  In the
meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You will have spoken with Madame Jacqueline,' broke
in de Lalain eagerly.  'The Magistrate and the Provosts
will have issued their proclamations, the city will be beflagged
and the people assembled on the Grand' Place, eager to see
Madame and her royal betrothed.  What a programme,
my good d'Inchy!' he concluded with unstinted enthusiasm.
'And how wisely conceived!  Of a truth, you have enchained
our fox.  He cannot now slip out of our sight.'
</p>

<p>
When the two old cronies finally took leave of one another,
they had prepared everything for their next day's box of
surprise.  A surprise it would be for everybody, and
Monseigneur d'Inchy could indeed congratulate himself on the
happy cannon-shot which he would fire off on the morrow,
and which would wake this sad and dormant city from its
weary somnolence.  The alliance with the Royal House of
France would prove a splendid stimulus for the waning
courage of the people, whilst a fickle Valois Prince would
at the same time learn that it is not easy to play fast and
loose with a nation that was ruled by such diplomatic and
determined men as were M. le Comte de Lalain and
Monseigneur d'Inchy, governor of Cambray.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
As for de Landas, he probably spent that evening some
of the happiest hours which he had experienced for some
time.  It seemed indeed as if Fate, having buffeted him
about so unmercifully these past few weeks, was determined
to compensate him for everything that he had suffered.
</p>

<p>
When he received Monseigneur's letter, he was still
fresh from his stormy interview with Jacqueline, still fresh
from the discovery which he had made of at any rate a
part of his rival's secret.  As to what use he would make
of this discovery, he had not yet made up his mind: his
dark, vengeful soul was for the nonce consumed with rage
at thought of seeing Jacqueline happy in the love of the man
whom he so cordially hated.  In the ordinary course of
events, he would have been perfectly content to see her
married&mdash;for political reasons, lovelessly or even unhappily&mdash;to
any man who was influential enough to win her at the
hands of her ambitious guardian.  But to think of her
bestowing her love and her kisses on another was wont
to drive de Landas to the verge of mania.  He did not love
Jacqueline de Broyart.  He had told her so, and he
knew that her fortune would never be his.  But he had
always desired her, and did so still; and such are the
tortuous ways of a depraved heart, that he would have
been content to lose her only if he knew that she would
be unhappy.
</p>

<p>
Now, suddenly, Fate had changed everything.  Instead
of impotent rage and futile scheming, Monseigneur's orders
had placed in his hands the very weapon which he needed
to consummate that revenge of which he dreamed.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
'See to it, My dear de Landas,' Monseigneur had written,
'that for the next four and twenty Hours a full Company of the
Town garrison is afoot, and that no one leave this City on any
pretext whatsoever.  I have prepared a special pageant for
the People&mdash;a day of Festivity, wherein I will make a joyful
Announcement to them from the Balcony of the Town Hall.
This announcement has a direct bearing not only on the
Future of our sorely-stricken Province, but also on that of her
fairest Daughter.  Both these great Issues are inextricably
bound together, and to-morrow will see them ratified before
our assembled people.  So, see to it, My dear de Landas,
that the Garrison under your Command do keep Order in the
Town, so that there should be no disturbance likely to mar the
solemnity of the occasion.  There are always Malcontents in
every Community and dissentients to every measure of public
good.  But I know that You at least have always been at one
with Me in earnest desire to see our beloved country
placed under the protection of our mighty neighbour, and that
You will therefore rejoice with Me that that desire will at
last be fulfilled.  Because of Your unswerving loyalty to me
and to Our cause, You shall be the first to know that the
mysterious stranger whom We have so long harboured within
Our gates and who chose to be known to Us all as the Prince
de Froidmont, is none other than Monsieur duc d'Anjou et
d'Alençon, Brother of His Majesty the King of France, who
came to Cambray for the express purpose of wooing Madame
Jacqueline de Broyart, Our Ward, to be his Wife.  That
he has succeeded in winning her promise is the announcement
which I desire to make to our People to-morrow.  I
also will give them the assurance that, in consequence of
this alliance with the royal House of Valois, We may reckon
on the full might and support of France to deliver Us from
Our enemies.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
De Landas crushed the welcome letter in his hand in the
excess of his joy.  He could have screamed aloud with
unholy rapture.
</p>

<p>
'There is a fraud here, of course.  Monseigneur has been
hoodwinked.  The Prince de Froidmont is not Duc d'Anjou!'
he cried exultantly.  'This much I know.  And now, friend
Beelzebub and all your myrmidons, grant me aid, so that I
may unmask that miscreant in a truly dramatic manner!
Something must and shall be done, to turn that fateful
hour to-morrow into one of triumph for me, and of humiliation
for the woman who has dared to scorn my love.  As for
the man who has filched her from me, this same hour will
be one which shall cover him with such boundless infamy,
that for Jacqueline the very memory of his kisses will for
ever remain an agony of shame.'
</p>

<p>
He sent a hasty summons to his intimates&mdash;to Maarege,
de Borel, du Prêt and the whole of the gang of hot-headed
malcontents, and just like in the Archiepiscopal Palace,
so in the lodgings occupied by Messire de Landas, a Council
of War was held which lasted late into the night.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
It was a dark and stormy evening after a brilliant day;
and some time after the cathedral bell had struck the hour
of ten, Messire de Landas, commanding the town garrison,
was making the round of the city gates.
</p>

<p>
He had his man, Pierre, with him&mdash;a fellow well known
to the guard.  At the gate of Cantimpré, Messire desired
that the bridge be lowered, for he wished to assure
himself that everything was as it should be, over on the
right bank of the river.  Far away to the right and left,
the lights of the Duke of Parma's encampment could be
distinctly seen.  The archers at the gate begged Messire
not to venture too far out into the darkness, for the Spanish
patrols were very wide-awake, and they were like cats for
sighting a man in the dark.  But Messire thought it his
duty to cross the bridge, and to see if all was well on the
other side.  He refused to take a bodyguard with him in
case the Spanish patrols were on the alert.  Messire de
Landas was known to be very brave; he preferred to take such
risks alone.
</p>

<p>
Only his man Pierre accompanied him.
</p>

<p>
The archers kept a sharp look-out.  But the night was
very dark, a veritable gale was blowing from the south-west,
and the driven rain was blinding.  Messire crossed
the bridge with Pierre, after which the darkness swallowed
them both up.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later, the guard at the gate, the archers
and gunners, heard the sharp report of two musket shots,
following closely upon one another, and coming from over
the right bank of the river.  Trembling with anxiety, they
marvelled if Messire were safe.  The sheriff, who had no
special orders from the commandant to meet the present
eventuality, did not know what to do.  He was ready
to tear out his hair in an agony of apprehension.  Had
it not been quite so dark he would have sent out a
search-party, for Messire still tarried.  But, as it was, his
men might fall straight into a <i>guet-apens</i> and be
massacred in the gloom, without doing any good to any one.
Skilled and able-bodied men were becoming precious
assets in Cambray: their lives could not be carelessly
jeopardized.
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour of heartrending suspense went by,
after which Messire's footstep was suddenly heard upon
the bridge.  He returned alone.  The archers and gunners
crowded round him, with the anxious query upon their
lips: 'Pierre?'
</p>

<p>
No one really cared about Pierre.  Messire de Landas
and his gang were not popular in Cambray.  But the
incident had been rendered weird and awesome by the darkness
and the bad weather, and Messire's obstinacy in venturing
out so far.
</p>

<p>
M. de Landas appeared moody and silent.  No doubt
he felt responsible for his servant's fate.  But he answered
the men's questions quite straightforwardly, more fully
too and with less brusqueness than was his wont when
speaking with subordinates.
</p>

<p>
'I had my suspicions aroused to-day,' he said, 'by
something which our spies reported to me, that the
Spaniards contemplated one of their famous surprise attacks
under cover of this murky darkness.  So I was determined
to venture on the Bapaume Road and see if I could discover
anything.  Pierre insisted on coming with me.  We kept
our eyes and ears open and crawled along in the ditch on
hands and knees.  Suddenly we were fired on without any
warning.  I lay low under cover of the ditch, not moving,
hardly breathing, and thought that Pierre was doing
likewise.  I heard the Spanish patrols move noiselessly away.
Then I crept out of my hiding-place, almost surprised at
finding myself alive.  I called softly to Pierre, but received
no answer; then I groped about for him.  Presently I
found him.  He had been shot twice&mdash;through the
back&mdash;and must have died on the instant.'
</p>

<p>
The story was plausible enough, nor did any one doubt
it.  The men cared so little about Pierre, who was
overbearing and surly.  But what had actually happened was
vastly different.
</p>

<p>
It was this&mdash;Messire le Marquis de Landas, accompanied
by Pierre, had in truth crossed the bridge, and as soon as
the darkness had swallowed them up, the two men had
walked rapidly along the Bapaume Road, until they were
challenged by a Spanish patrol on duty.  Messire gave the
password, and the patrol not only halted but also stood
at attention, for the password which had been given was
one used only by Spanish gentlemen of high rank in the
King's armies.
</p>

<p>
'You will conduct my servant at once before His Highness
the Duke of Parma,' Messire de Landas said to the man
in command of the patrol.
</p>

<p>
And to Pierre he added in a whisper: 'All that you
have to do when you see His Highness is to give him this
letter from me and tell him that we are quite prepared
for to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
He gave Pierre a letter, then ordered the patrol to fire
a couple of musket-shots.  After which, he waited for a
few minutes, and finally returned alone to the city gate.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
HOW SOME OF THESE SUCCEEDED
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Jacqueline was sitting in the self-same deep
window-embrasure from whence she had listened&mdash;oh, so long
ago!&mdash;to that song, which would for ever remain for her
the sweetest song on earth:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Mignonne, allons voir si la rose&mdash;&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Only a few hours had gone by since she had reached the
sublimal height of ecstatic happiness&mdash;only a few hours
since she had tasted the bitter fruit of renunciation.  Since
then she had had a good cry, and felt better for it; but
since then also she had encountered a venomous reptile
on her way, and had been polluted by its touch.
</p>

<p>
Even to suggest that Jacqueline's pure faith in the man
she loved had been troubled by de Landas' insidious
suggestions, would be to wrong her fine and steadfast character.
She did not mistrust her knight; for her he still stood far
above the base calumnies hurled at him by a spiteful rival;
but, somehow, de Landas' venom had succeeded in making
her sorrow more acute, less endurable.  Oh! if only she
could have shared with her beloved all his secrets and his
difficulties, if only he had thought her worthy of his entire
trust!
</p>

<p>
Words which he had spoken ere he finally went away
rang portentously in her ear&mdash;ominous words, which she
had not heeded at the moment, for her heart was then over-full
with the misery of that farewell, but which now took on,
despite herself, a menacing and awesome significance.
</p>

<p>
With frowning brows and hands tightly clasped together,
Jacqueline sat there, motionless, the while memory called
back those words which in very truth did fill her heart with
dread.
</p>

<p>
'If within the future,' Messire had said, 'aught should
occur to render me odious in your sight, will you at least
remember that, whatever else I may have done that was
unworthy and base, my love for you has been as pure and
sacred as is the love of the lark for the sun.'
</p>

<p>
He had gone after that&mdash;gone before she could ask him
for an explanation of these ununderstandable words, before
she could affirm her perfect faith and trust in him.  Then
the memory of them had faded from her ken, merged as it
was in her great, all-embracing sorrow, until the wand of
a devilish magician had brought them forth from out the
ashes of forgetfulness, and she was left more forlorn than
she had been before.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Monseigneur the governor found her in the late afternoon,
still sitting in the window embrasure, the large, lofty room
in darkness, save for the fitful glow of the fire which was
burning low in the monumental hearth.  The patter of
the rain against the window panes made a weird, melancholy
sound, which alone broke the silence that hung upon the
place with an eerie sense of desolation.  Monseigneur
shuddered as he entered.
</p>

<p>
'B-r-r-r!' he exclaimed.  'My dear Jacqueline!  I had
no thought that you were moping here all alone&mdash;and in
the dark, too!&mdash;or I would have been here sooner to cheer
your spirits with my good news.'
</p>

<p>
'You and your good news are right welcome, Monseigneur,'
responded Jacqueline with a pathetic effort at gaiety.
'I was out in the garden most of the day,' she continued
composedly, 'and was resting for awhile in the gathering
dusk, as this awful weather hath made it impossible to go
out again.'
</p>

<p>
'Gathering dusk, forsooth!' he retorted.  'Send for
your women, Madame, and order them to bring in the
candles.  Light!  We want more light, laughter and joy
at this hour!  I would I could light a bonfire, to turn the
night into day!'
</p>

<p>
He was obviously nervy and excited, paced up and down
the room in a state of nerve-tension, very unlike his usual
dignified self.  Jacqueline, a little puzzled, obeyed him
promptly.  She rang the bell and ordered Nicolle to send
in the candles, and while the women busied themselves
about the room, disposing candelabra upon the tables and
consols, she watched her guardian keenly.  He certainly
appeared strangely excited, and now and then he darted
quick, inquiring glances upon her, and when she met those
glances, he smiled as if in triumph.
</p>

<p>
'Let us sit by the fire, my dear,' he said genially, after
he had dismissed Nicolle and the women with an impatient
gesture.  'I came to see you alone and without ceremony,
because I wished for the selfish pleasure of imparting my
good news to you myself.'
</p>

<p>
She sat down in the tall chair beside the fire, and
Monseigneur sat opposite to her.  She had on a dress of
dark-coloured satin, upon the shiny surface of which the
flickering firelight drew quaint and glowing arabesques.  She
rested her elbow on the arm of her chair and leaned her
head against her hand, thus keeping her delicate face in
shadow, lest Monseigneur should note the pallor of her
cheeks and the tear-stains around her eyes.  But otherwise
she was quite composed, was able to smile too at his
eagerness and obvious embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
It was his turn to study her keenly now, and he did so
with evident pleasure.  Not so very many years ago he,
too, had been a young gallant, favoured by fortune and not
flint-hearted either where women were concerned.  He
had buried two wives, and felt none the worse for that,
and still ready to turn a compliment to a pretty woman,
and to give her the full measure of his admiration.  He would
have been less than a man now, if he had withstood the
charm of the pretty picture which his ward presented, in
the harmonious setting of her high-backed chair, and with
the crimson glow of the fire-light turning her fair hair to
living gold.
</p>

<p>
'Put down your hand, Jacqueline,' he said, 'so that I
may see your pretty face.'
</p>

<p>
'My head aches sadly, Monseigneur,' she rejoined with a
pathetic little sigh, 'and mine eyes are heavy.  'Tis but
vanity that causes me to hold my hand before my face.'
</p>

<p>
'Neither headaches nor heavy eyes could mar the beauty
of the fairest lily of Flanders,' he went on with elaborate
gallantry.  'So I pray you humour me, and let me see you
eye to eye.'
</p>

<p>
She did as he asked, and dropped her hand.  Monseigneur
made no remark on her pallor, was obviously too deeply
absorbed in his joyful news to notice her swollen eyes.  She
tried to smile, and said lightly:
</p>

<p>
'And why should Monseigneur desire to see a face, every
line of which he knows by heart?'
</p>

<p>
He leaned forward in his chair and said slowly, keeping
his eyes fixed upon her:
</p>

<p>
'Because I wish to behold the future Duchesse d'Anjou
and d'Alençon, the future sister of the King of France!'
</p>

<p>
She made no reply, but sat quite still, her face turned
toward the fire, presenting the outline of her dainty profile
to the admiring gaze of her guardian.  Monseigneur was
silent for a moment or two, was leaning back in his chair
once more, and regarding her with an air of complacency,
which he took no pains to disguise.
</p>

<p>
'It means the salvation of the Netherlands!' he said
with a deep sigh of satisfaction.  'We can now count on
the whole might of France to rid us of our enemies, and
after that to a long era of prosperity and of religious liberty,
when Madame Jacqueline de Broyart shares with her lord
the Sovereignty of the Netherlands.'
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline remained silent, her aching eyes fixed in the
hot embers of the fire.  So the blow had fallen sooner than
she thought.  When, in the arbour, she had made her
profession of faith before her knight, and told him that she
belonged not to herself but to her country, she did not think
that her country would claim her quite so soon.  Vaguely
she knew that some day her guardian would dispose of her
hand and fortune, and that she would have to ratify a
bargain made for her person, for the sake of that fair land
of Flanders which was so dear to her.  But awhile ago,
all that had seemed so remote; limitless time seemed to
stretch out before her, wherein she could pursue her dreams
of the might-have-been.
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur's announcement&mdash;for it was that&mdash;came as
a hammer-blow upon her hopes of peace.  She had only
just wakened from her dream, and already the bitter-sweet
boon of memory would be denied to her.  Stunned under
the blow, she made no attempt at defiance.  With her
heart dead within her, what cared she in the future what
became of her body?  Since love was denied her, there
was always the altruistic sentiment of patriotism to comfort
her in her loneliness; and the thought of self-sacrifice on
the altar of her stricken country would, perhaps, compensate
her for that life-long sorrow which was destined to mar her
life.
</p>

<p>
'No wonder you are silent, Jacqueline,' Monseigneur was
saying, and she heard him speaking as if through a thick
veil which smothered the sound of his voice; 'for to you
this happy news comes as a surprise.  Confess that you
never thought your old guardian was capable of negotiating
so brilliant an alliance for you!'
</p>

<p>
'I knew,' she rejoined quietly, 'that my guardian would
do everything in his power to further the good of our
country.'
</p>

<p>
'And incidentally to promote your happiness, my dear.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' she said, with an indifferent shrug of the shoulders,
'my happiness is not in question, is it?  Else you would not
propose that I should wed a Prince of the House of Valois.'
</p>

<p>
'I am not so sure,' he replied, with a humorous twinkle
in his old eyes.  '<i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou, is not&mdash;or I am
much mistaken&mdash;quite the rogue that mischievous rumour
hath painted.'
</p>

<p>
'Let us hope, for my sake,' she retorted dryly, 'that
rumour hath wronged him in all particulars.'
</p>

<p>
'In one, at any rate, I'll vouch for that.  <i>Monsieur</i> is
more than commonly well-favoured&mdash;a handsome figure
of a man, with the air and the voice of a soldier.'
</p>

<p>
'You know him well?'
</p>

<p>
'I have seen much of him,' said Monseigneur with an
enigmatic smile, 'these past four weeks.'
</p>

<p>
'These past four weeks?' she exclaimed.  'But you
have not been out of Cambray.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor has he,' put in Monseigneur quietly.
</p>

<p>
She frowned, deeply puzzled.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou hath been in Cambray?' she
asked, 'these past four weeks?'
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
'And I have never seen him?'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed you have, my dear Jacqueline; on more than
one occasion.'
</p>

<p>
'Not to my knowledge, then.'
</p>

<p>
'No.  Not to your knowledge.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't understand,' she murmured.  'Why should so
exalted a prince as the Duc d'Anjou be in Cambray all this
while?'
</p>

<p>
'Because he desired to woo Madame Jacqueline de
Broyart, duchesse et princesse de Ramèse.'
</p>

<p>
'Without my knowledge?'
</p>

<p>
'Without your knowledge&mdash;outwardly.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! nothing very obscure, my dear; nothing very
remarkable.  <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou is young&mdash;he hath
a romantic turn of mind.  He admired you and desired
you in marriage, but chose to woo you&mdash;have I not said
that he is romantic?&mdash;chose to woo you under a mask.'
</p>

<p>
She gave a gasp, and quickly put her hand to her mouth
to smother a cry.  She sat bolt upright now, her two hands
clutching the arms of her chair, her eyes&mdash;wide open,
glowing, scared&mdash;fixed upon her guardian.  He, obtuse and
matter-of-fact, mistook the gasp and the tense expression
of her face.
</p>

<p>
'No wonder you are aghast, my dear,' he said cheerily.
'Not unpleasantly, I hope.  More than once it seemed to
your old guardian that <i>Monsieur's</i> martial presence was not
altogether distasteful to you.  He hath sharper eyes, hath
the old man, than you gave him credit for&mdash;what?  Ah,
well!  I was young too, once, and I still like to bask in the
sunshine of romance.  'Twas a pretty conceit on <i>Monsieur's</i>
part, methinks, to pay his court to you under a disguise&mdash;to
win your love by the charm of his personality, ere you
realized the great honour that a Prince of the Royal House
of France was doing to our poor country, by wooing her
fairest maid.'
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur continued to ramble on in the same strain.
Jacqueline hardly heard what he said.  She was striving
with all her might to appear composed, to understand what
the old man was saying, and to reply to him with some
semblance of coherence.  Above all, she was striving to
get the mastery over her voice, for presently she would
have to speak, to say something which would shake her
guardian's complacency, open his eyes to the truth, the
whole hideous, abominable truth; without ... without
... Heavens above, this must be a hideous dream!
</p>

<p>
'It was all arranged with de Montigny, you remember?'
Monseigneur continued, still engrossed in his own rhetoric,
too blind to see that Jacqueline was on the verge of a
collapse.  '<i>Monsieur</i> was so fanciful, and we had to give
in to him.  We all desired the alliance with our whole
hearts, and Madame la Reyne de Navarre did approve of
our schemes.  I must say that de Lalain and I were against
the masquerade at first, but <i>Monsieur's</i> soldierlike
personality soon won our approval.  And imagine our joy when
we realized that our dear Jacqueline was not wholly indifferent
to him either.  He came to us this afternoon and made
formal demand for your hand in marriage....  So de
Lalain and I have taken measures that our poor people do
have a holiday to-morrow, when Madame Jacqueline de
Broyart, duchesse et princesse de Ramèse, will solemnly
plight her troth to <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou.  So, my dear
Jacqueline, I entreat you to wear your loveliest gown.
Flanders is proud of her fairest flower.  Monsieur desired
to rejoin his armies to-day and leave the ceremony of
betrothal waiting for happier times; but de Lalain and I
would not hear of it.  Everything is prepared for a festive
holiday.  Of a truth, to-morrow's forenoon will see the
happiest hour which our sadly-afflicted province hath seen
these many years.'
</p>

<p>
He paused; I think, for want of breath: he certainly
had been talking uninterruptedly for the past ten minutes,
going over the whole ground of de Montigny's mission,
<i>Monsieur's</i> romantic desire and the final demand in marriage,
till Jacqueline could have screamed to him to cease torturing
her.  The hideousness of the mystery appalled her: some
dark treachery lurked here somewhere and she was caught
in a net of odious intrigues, out of which for the moment
she could see no issue.  A feeling of indescribable horror
came over her&mdash;a nameless, unspeakable terror, as in the
face of a yawning, bottomless abyss, on the brink of which
she stood and into which an unseen and mighty hand would
presently hurl her.
</p>

<p>
Something of that appalling state of mind must have
been reflected in her face, despite the almost superhuman
effort which she made not to allow Monseigneur to guess
at what was going on in her mind; for presently he looked
at her more keenly, and then said gently:
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline, my dear, you look so strange.  What is it?
Hath my news so gravely startled you?'
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, and when he reiterated his question,
and leaned forward in order to take her hand, she contrived
to say, moderately calmly, even though every word came
with an effort from her parched throat:
</p>

<p>
'The man with the mask? ... The Prince de
Froidmont? ... You are sure?'
</p>

<p>
'Sure of what, my dear?' he riposted.
</p>

<p>
'That he is the Duc d'Anjou?'
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur laughed loudly and long, apparently much
relieved.
</p>

<p>
'Oh! is that what troubles you, my child?' he said
gaily.  'Well then, let me assure you that I am as sure of
that as that I am alive.  Why!' he added, evidently much
surprised, 'how could you ask such a funny thing?'
</p>

<p>
'I did not know,' she murmured vaguely.  'Sometimes
an exalted prince will woo a maid by proxy ... so I
thought...'
</p>

<p>
But evidently the idea of Jacqueline's doubts greatly
tickled Monseigneur's fancy.
</p>

<p>
'What a strange conceit, my child!' he said with
condescending indulgence.  'By proxy, forsooth!  His
Highness came himself, not more than three days after Messire
de Montigny completed negotiations with him at La Fère.
He desired to remain incognito and chose to lodge in a poor
hostelry; but Madame la Reyne de Navarre begged us in
a letter writ by her own august hand, to make <i>Monsieur</i>
Duc d'Anjou, her dear brother, right welcome in Cambray.
By proxy!' and Monseigneur laughed again, highly amused.
'Why, His Highness was in my study but two hours ago,
and made formal proposal for your hand in marriage!'
</p>

<p>
Then, as the door behind him was thrown open and old
Nicolle, shuffling in, announced M. le Comte de Lalain,
d'Inchy turned to his old friend and said, highly delighted
with what he regarded as a good joke:
</p>

<p>
'Ah, my good de Lalain!  You could not have come at
a more opportune moment.  Here is our ward, so bewildered
at the news that she asks me whether I am sure that it is
truly <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou who has been masquerading
as the Prince de Froidmont.  Do reassure the child's mind,
I pray you; for in truth she seems quite scared.'
</p>

<p>
De Lalain, always a great stickler for etiquette, had in
the meanwhile advanced into the room, and was even now
greeting Jacqueline with all the ceremonial prescribed by
Maître Calviac.  Then only did he reply soberly:
</p>

<p>
'Sure, Madame?  Of course we are sure!  Why, 'tis
not two hours since he was standing before us and asking
for the hand of Madame Jacqueline de Broyart in marriage.
We knelt before him and kissed his hand, and to-morrow
we'll present him to the people as the future Sovereign Lord
of the Netherlands.'
</p>

<p>
'And so, my dear Jacqueline&mdash;&mdash;' concluded d'Inchy.
But he got no further, gave a loud call to Nicolle and the
women; for Madame had uttered a pitiful moan, slid out
of her chair, and was now lying on the floor in a swoon.

CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
WHILE OTHERS FAILED
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Of a truth, Monseigneur the governor was not gravely
perturbed by his ward's sudden attack of faintness.
He knew that women were subject to megrims and sundry
other fancies, and he was willing to admit that in his
excitement he had, perhaps, been too abrupt with her and too
brusque.  She had been scared, bewildered, no doubt, and
lost consciousness in her agitation.  But old Nicolle had
quickly come to the rescue with restoratives; and with the
prerogative of an old and trusted servant, she had bundled
Monseigneur and Monsieur de Lalain incontinently out of
the room.  Madame would soon be well, she said, only
needed rest.  She was overwrought and over fatigued with
so many banquets and public functions&mdash;such late hours,
too; and Madame not twenty!  Young people needed
plenty of sleep, and Madame, after a good and peaceful night,
would be quite well on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
So Monseigneur, fully reassured, went back to his
apartments and to his own business.  There was still a great
deal to be done, a great deal to see to&mdash;many people to
interview and many more orders to give, to ensure that
to-morrow's ceremony should be conducted not only with
perfect smoothness, but also that the preparations for it
be concluded with perfect secrecy.
</p>

<p>
M. de Lalain, d'Inchy's old friend, was an invaluable
helpmate, and de Landas too had for the occasion thrown
off that supercilious manner which he had adopted of late,
and had entered fully into the spirit of the affair.  There
was no fear that the wily Valois fox would slip from out
the trap which was being so skilfully laid for him.
</p>

<p>
Already messengers, dressed in Monseigneur the governor's
livery, were flying all over the town, carrying letters
and sign-manuals.  Directly these were delivered, extraordinary
bustle and activity came at once into being in the
official and municipal centres of the city.  The Provosts
could be seen, wearing their chain of office and hurrying
to the Town Hall, where they were received by the Chief
Magistrate.  Orders and counter-orders flew from one end
of the town to the other, from the Citadel to the Palace and
from Cantimpré to the Château, while, by special command
of M. le Marquis de Landas, the entire garrison, which
manned the forts, was under arms during the whole of that
night.
</p>

<p>
The humbler folk, scared by this unwonted turmoil, shut
themselves up with their families inside their houses, until
a persistent rumour reassured them that no fresh assault
on the part of the besieging army was expected, but rather
that a happy, joyful and hopeful proclamation would be
made by Monseigneur the governor on the morrow, from the
balcony of the Town Hall.  Whereupon fear and trouble
were for the moment put resolutely away.  The people
were beginning to suffer so acutely, that they were abjectly
thankful for any ray of hope, which gleamed through the
darkness of their ever-present misery.  With the Duke of
Parma's armies at their gates, they were still clinging to
the thought that some mighty Power would take compassion
on them, and come to their rescue with a force strong
enough to inflict a severe defeat upon the Spaniard.  They
had not yet reached the final stages of despair.  They were
still ready to seize every opportunity for forgetfulness, for
enjoyment even, whenever it was offered or allowed them.
Rumour had been persistent about the help which was
to come from France.  Messire de Balagny's presence in
the city had confirmed the hopes which had rested upon
those rumours.  Now, with the knowledge that Monseigneur
had a joyful announcement to make, mercurial temperaments
rose for awhile&mdash;especially among the young.  The older
people had been too often deluded with flowery promises
to believe in any good fortune for their unfortunate city.
They had seen the fate of others&mdash;of Mons and of Mechlin
and of Gand.  The might of the Spanish armies always
conquered in the end, and the rebellious cities had been
made to suffer untold brutalities, as a punishment for their
heroic resistance.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for the morale of Cambray, these older
people, these wiseacres, were still in the minority, and hope
is of all human attributes the strongest and the most
persistent.  So, despite the prognostications and fear of
pessimists, people rose early on the following morning, in order
betimes to decorate their houses.  Soon after dawn, activities
began; flags were dragged out of old, disused coffers
and hung out of windows and balconies; the women sought,
in their worm-eaten dower chests, for any scraps of finery
that may have survived from the happy olden days, before
their Spanish tyrants had made of this prosperous land a
forlorn wilderness.
</p>

<p>
By eight o'clock the beleaguered city looked almost gay.
The shops were closed; soldiers paraded the streets; the
city guilds, their masters and their 'prentices, came out
with banners flying, to stand in groups upon the Grand'
Place.  If a stranger could have dropped into Cambray
from the skies on that fine April morning, he would of a
truth have doubted if any Spanish army was encamped
around these walls.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Even Gilles de Crohin, absorbed as he was in his own
affairs, could not fail to notice the generally festive air
which hung about the place.  In the quarter where he lodged,
it is true that very little of that holiday mood had found
its way down the narrow streets and into the interior of
squalid houses, where the pinch of cold and hunger had
already made itself insistently felt.  But as soon as he was
past the Place aux Bois, he began to wonder what was in
the wind.  The populace had been at obvious pains to put
aside for the moment every outward sign of the misery which
it endured.  The women had donned their best clothes,
the men no longer hung about at street corners, looking
hungry and gaunt.  They did not even scowl in the wake
of the masked stranger, so lately the object of their ire, as
the latter hurried along on his way to the Palace.
</p>

<p>
And then there were the flags, and the open windows,
the draped balconies and pots of bright-coloured early
tulips&mdash;all so different to the dreary, drab appearance which
Cambray had worn of late.
</p>

<p>
But, nevertheless, Gilles himself would have told you
afterwards that no suspicion of Monseigneur d'Inchy's
intentions crossed his mind.  Vaguely he thought that
Messire de Balagny's arrival had been announced to the
townfolk, and that the promise of help from France had
been made the occasion of a public holiday.  And he
himself was in too much of a fume to pay serious heed to
anything but his own affairs&mdash;to anything, in fact, but his
own departure, which had been so provokingly delayed
until this morning.
</p>

<p>
And this veracious chronicle has all along put it on record
that Messire Gilles de Crohin was not a man of patience.
Imagine his choler, his fretting rage when, fully prepared
for his journey, mounted upon the same horse which had
brought him into Cambray a month ago, and duly accompanied
by Maître Jehan, who had a pack-horse on the lead,
he had presented himself on the previous afternoon at the
Porte Notre Dame with his original safe-conduct, and was
incontinently refused exit from the city, owing to strict
orders issued by the commandant of the garrison that no
one should be allowed to pass out of the gates under any
pretext whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
Gilles had argued, persuaded, demanded; but he himself
was too thorough a soldier not to have realized from the
first that every argument would be futile.  The captain of
the guard assured him that he could do nothing in the face
of the strict and uncompromising orders which he had
received.  Gilles was of course quite certain that some one
had blundered&mdash;a mere matter of formality, which
Monseigneur the governor could put right with a stroke of the
pen&mdash;but it was obviously not for a subordinate officer to
question his orders, or to take any revision thereto upon
himself; and Gilles, after receiving the captain's courteous
regrets, had no option but to ride away.
</p>

<p>
It was then six o'clock of the afternoon, and the brilliance
of the early spring day was quickly fading into dusk.  A
boisterous wind had sprung up, which brought heavy banks
of cloud along, threatening rain.  But, rain or shine, Gilles
had no thought as yet of giving up his purpose.  There were
other gates within the city walls, and wrapping his mantle
closely round his shoulders, he gave spur to his horse and
started on a new quest, closely followed by Maître Jehan.
It is on record that he went the round of every gate, armed
with his safe-conduct and with as much patience as he could
muster.  Alternately he tried bribery, persuasion, stealth;
but nothing availed.  The town garrison was everywhere
under arms; orders had been given, and no one, be he the
highest in the land, was allowed to leave.
</p>

<p>
Had the matter been vital or the adventure worth the
trial, I doubt not but what Messire would have endeavoured
to get through at all costs&mdash;have scaled the city walls, swam
the river, challenged the Spanish lines and run the gauntlet
of archers and gunners, in order to accomplish what he
wanted, if he had wanted it badly.  But a few hours' delay
in his journey could make no matter, and truth to tell he
was in no mood for senseless adventure.
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile, however, several hours had been wasted
on fruitless errands.  It was late evening.  The heavy gale
had brought along its due complement of rain.  It were
certainly not seemly to disturb Monseigneur the governor
in the Palace at this hour, so Gilles and Jehan returned,
sorely disappointed, to their lodgings, there to spend a
sleepless night, waiting for the first reasonable hour in the
morning wherein Monseigneur the governor might be
expected to transact business.  And I can confidently affirm
that no suspicion of what was in contemplation for the
confusion of the fickle Prince, crossed Gilles' mind, as he
lay half the night, staring into the darkness, with the image
of Jacqueline haunting his tortured brain.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
At eight o'clock the next morning, he was once more at
the Archiepiscopal Palace, demanding to see Monseigneur.
Not wishing to challenge any comparison at this eleventh
hour between his two entities, he had elected to present
himself under his disguise and his mask, and to send in a
greeting to Monseigneur with the message that Messire le
Prince de Froidmont desired to speak with him immediately.
</p>

<p>
But it seems that Monseigneur had been very ill all night
and had not yet risen.  A leech was in attendance, who,
ignorant of the true rank of this early visitor, strictly
forbade that the sick man should be disturbed.  No doubt
if Messire le Prince de Froidmont would present himself a
couple of hours later&mdash;the leech added suavely&mdash;Monseigneur
would be prepared to see him.
</p>

<p>
It was in very truth a trial of patience, and I marvel
how Gilles' temper stood the strain.  The fact that he was
a stranger in the city, without a friend, surrounded too by
a goodly number of enemies, may be accountable for his
exemplary patience.  Certain it is that he did once again
return to his lodgings, anathematizing in his heart all these
stodgy and procrastinating Flemings, but otherwise calm
and, I repeat, wholly unsuspecting.
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock, a runner came to him with a message
that Monseigneur had been unexpectedly summoned to
the Town Hall, but, not wishing to disappoint M. le Prince
de Froidmont, he begged the latter to go forthwith to see
him there.  So Gilles left horses and baggage in Maître
Julien's charge and, accompanied by Jehan, he proceeded
on foot to the Town Hall.  He had much difficulty in forcing
his way through the crowd, which had become very dense,
especially in and about the Grand' Place.
</p>

<p>
Gilles, indeed, could not help but notice the festive
appearance of the town, the flags, the flowers, the banners
of the guilds.  Above all, the good-humour of the crowd
was in such strange contrast to their habitual surliness.
Instead of uttering insults against the masked stranger,
as he jostled them with his elbows and a rapid 'By your
leave!' they chaffed and teased him, laughed and joked
among themselves in perfect good-humour.
</p>

<p>
In and about the Town Hall there was a large concourse
of people, city fathers and high dignitaries in official attire.
The perron steps were decorated with huge pots of Dutch
earthenware, placed at intervals all the way up as far as
the entrance doors and filled with sheaves of white Madonna
lilies, produced at great cost at this season of the year in
the hothouses of the Archiepiscopal Palace.  Pots containing
the same priceless flowers could also be seen up on the
huge balcony above the entrance, and showing through the
interstices of the stonework of the splendid balustrade.
There was also a guard of honour&mdash;halbardiers in their
gorgeous attire&mdash;who lined the hall and the grand staircase
as far as the upper floor.
</p>

<p>
When Gilles appeared outside the huge entrance gates,
an usher in sober black came forward from some hidden
corner of the hall, and approached him with marked
deference.  Monseigneur the governor had given orders that
directly M. le Prince de Froidmont presented himself at
the Town Hall he was to be shown up to the Council Room.
</p>

<p>
Gilles, having ordered Jehan to wait for him below,
followed the usher up the grand staircase, noting with
the first gleam of suspicious surprise that the guard
presented arms as he went by.
</p>

<p>
But even then he did not guess.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
The Council Room was crowded when Gilles entered.
At first he felt quite dazed.  The whole scene was so
ununderstandable, so different to what he had expected.  He had
thought of finding Monseigneur the governor alone in a
small apartment; and here he was ushered into a magnificent
hall, harmoniously ornamented with priceless Flemish
tapestry above the rich carving of the wainscoting.  The
hall was crowded with men, some of whom he had vaguely
seen on the night of the banquet at the Archiepiscopal
Palace.  There was the Chief Magistrate, a venerable old
man, gorgeously decorated with a massive gold chain and
other insignia of authority; there were the Mayors of the
City guilds, each recognizable by their robes of state and
the emblems of their trades; there were the Provosts and
the Captains of the guard and the Chiefs of the Guild of
Archers, with their crimson sashes, and there was also
Monseigneur the governor, looking more pompous and solemn
than he had ever done before.
</p>

<p>
Gilles was once more deeply thankful for the mask which
covered his face, together with its expression of boundless
astonishment, amounting to consternation, which must
inevitably have betrayed him.  Already he would have
retreated if he could; but even as the swift thought crossed
his mind, the ushers closed the doors behind him, the guard
fell in, and he was&mdash;there was no mistaking it&mdash;a virtual
prisoner.
</p>

<p>
Dressed for the journey, booted and spurred, with leather
jerkin and heavy belt, he stood for a moment, isolated, at
the end of the room, a magnificent and picturesque figure,
mysterious and defiant&mdash;yes, defiant!  For he knew in
one instant that he had been trapped and that he, the
gambler, had been set to play a losing game.
</p>

<p>
His quick, keen glance swept over the dignified assembly.
Monseigneur, in the centre, was advancing to greet him,
bowing almost to the ground in the excess of his deference.
Every head was bared, the captains of the guard had drawn
their swords and held them up to the salute.  Through the
wide-open, monumental windows, the pale April sun came
peeping in, throwing a glint of gold upon the rich robes of
the Provosts and the Mayors.  A murmur of respectful
greeting went round the room, followed immediately by
loud and prolonged cheering; and Gilles&mdash;suddenly alive
to the whole situation&mdash;took his plumed hat from off his
head and, with a splendidly insolent gesture, made a sweeping
bow to the assembled dignitaries.  His life, his honour,
his safety, were hanging by a thread.  He stood like a
trapped beast before a number of men who anon would be
clamouring perhaps for his blood; but the whole situation
suddenly struck him as so boundlessly humorous, the
solemnity of all these worthy Flemings would presently
be so completely ruffled, that Gilles forgot the danger he
was in, the precariousness of the position in which he stood,
only to remember its entirely ludicrous aspect.
</p>

<p>
'Long live His Highness le Duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon!'
came in rousing cheers, which woke the echoes of the old
Town Hall.
</p>

<p>
And outside, on the Grand' Place, the people heard the
cheering.  They did not know yet what it was about, but
they had come out on this fine April morning to enjoy
themselves, to forget their troubles, their danger, their
miseries; and when they heard the cheering, they responded
with full throat and heart, and acclaimed not what they
knew but what they hoped.
</p>

<p>
'You have beaten me, Messire,' Gilles said in a
good-humoured whisper to Monseigneur the governor, as the
latter bent one knee to the ground and kissed the gracious
hand of the Valois Prince.  'Never was game so skilfully
trapped!  All my compliments, Messire.  You are a
born&mdash;&mdash;' 'liar' he would have said, but checked himself
just in time and used the smoother word&mdash;'diplomatist.'
</p>

<p>
'Your Highness will not grudge us our little ruse,' d'Inchy
riposted under his breath with a suave smile.  'It is all
for your glorification and the exaltation of our promised
union with France.'
</p>

<p>
'Take care, Messire!' retorted Gilles, 'that your want
of trust in me doth not receive the punishment it
deserves.'
</p>

<p>
He had still the thought that he might run away.  The
only time in the whole course of his life that Gilles de Crohin
had the desire to show a clean pair of heels to the enemy!
If he could only have seen the slightest chance of getting
away, he would have taken it&mdash;through door or window,
up the chimney or the side of a house&mdash;any way, in fact,
out of this abominable trap which these astute Flemings
had so skilfully laid for him.  And this, despite the fact
that he had spied his arch-enemy, de Landas, at the far
end of the room&mdash;de Landas, who was gazing on him, not
only in mockery but also in triumph.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Gilles was ready to turn his back even on
de Landas&mdash;anything, anything, in fact, to get away; for
the situation, besides being ludicrous, was tragic too, and
desperate.  One false move on his part, one unconsidered
word, and the whole fabric of Madame la Reyne's schemes
would totter to the ground.  He seemed to see her now,
with her gracious hand extended towards him and the tears
streaming down her cheeks, while she said with solemn
earnestness: 'When a prince of the house of Valois breaks
his word, the shame of it bears upon us all!'  He seemed
to see himself with his hand upon the crosshilt of his sword,
swearing by all that he held most sacred and most dear
that he would see this business through to the end.  Indeed,
the end was in sight, and he felt like a soldier who has
been left all alone to defend a citadel and ordered to hold
it at all costs.
</p>

<p>
That citadel was the honour of France.
</p>

<p>
And the soldier-nature in him not only refused to give
in, but at this supreme hour rejoiced in the task.  He
<i>would</i> hold on at all costs for the honour of <i>Monsieur</i>, his
master; but, above all, for the honour of France.  If
contumely, disgrace or shame was to fall, in consequence
of this gigantic hoax, then it must fall entirely on
him&mdash;Gilles de Crohin, the penniless adventurer&mdash;not upon a
Prince of the Royal House of France.  Either he would be
able to extricate himself from this desperate position with
the mask still upon his face and <i>Monsieur's</i> secret still
inviolate before these assembled Flemings, or the whole
burden of knavery and imposture must fall upon him
alone&mdash;the shameless rogue who had impersonated his master
for some unavowable purpose, and perpetrated this impudent
fraud for the sake of some paltry gain.
</p>

<p>
It only took him a few seconds thus to pass the whole
situation, present and future, in a brief review before his
mind.  Having done it, he felt stronger and keener for the
fight and ready for any eventuality.  The honour of
France!&mdash;and he left here to guard it! ... Ye gods! but he felt
prouder than any king!  Contumely, disgrace, exposure,
an ignominious flight&mdash;mayhap a shameful death.  Bah! what
mattered anything so long as the honour of France
and of her Royal House remained untarnished before the
world?
</p>

<p>
Fortunately Jacqueline was not here!  Perhaps she would
not come!  Perhaps these wily fools, when they had set
their trap, had left her out of their reckoning.  In which
case, all might be well; the chances of exposure remained
remote.  A little more impudence, a brief half-hour still
of this abominable rôle, and the curtain must fall at last
upon the farcical tragedy and he, Gilles, would be free to
become an honest man once more.
</p>

<p>
A little luck!!  And, remember that he was a gambler,
and staking his all upon the last throw!
</p>

<p>
And as, one by one, the city dignitaries came up to be
presented by the governor to His Highness, and as the
minutes sped away, hope once more knocked at the
gateway of the adventurer's heart.  One by one they came,
these solemn Flemings.  They bent the knee and kissed
the hand of the Prince who was to be their Sovereign Lord.
And some of them were old and others very rheumatic;
most of them appeared to Gilles highly ridiculous in this
homage rendered to an impostor.  The desire to laugh aloud
became positive torture after awhile, and yet nothing but
self-possession <i>could</i> carry the day, now that every second
rendered Gilles' position more hopeful.
</p>

<p>
For still Jacqueline did not come!  Jacqueline! the only
person inside this city who could betray him, and she the
one being in the entire world before whom he would have
wished to remain deserving and unimpeached.  She of a
truth would know him amongst a thousand; her loving,
searching eyes would laugh at masks and disguises!  Her
finger alone could, at sight of him, point at him with scorn;
her voice, like that of an avenging angel, could be raised
against him, saying:
</p>

<p>
'That man is a liar and a cheat!  He is not the Duc
d'Anjou!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
Monseigneur the governor acted throughout as the Master
of Ceremonies.  Obsequious and suave, he seemed to have
no wish save to please His Highness in all things, and to
make him forget the want of trust that the present ceremony
implied.  He hovered round Gilles, executing a manoeuvre
which the latter was certainly too guileless to notice.  It
was a case of: 'On this side, I entreat Your Highness!'
and 'Here is Messire de Haynin, who craves the honour...'
or 'If Your Highness would deign to speak with Messire
d'Anthoin.'  All very subtle and unnoticeable, but it meant
that every time a city father came to kiss hands, Gilles, in
order to greet him, had to take a step or two forward, and
that each step brought him a trifle nearer to the open window.
That window gave directly on La Bretèque, the vast terrace-like
balcony which overlooked the Grand' Place and which
had so often been the scene of historic proclamations.
Suddenly Gilles found himself there, in the open, with a
huge concourse of people down below at his feet.
</p>

<p>
He had Monseigneur the governor on his left, and the
company of city fathers and dignitaries had followed him
out on La Bretèque.  They were standing in a compact
group around him; and all down the length of the balcony,
at the foot of the balustrade, there were huge pots filled with
those Madonna lilies, which seemed like the very emblem
of Jacqueline.
</p>

<p>
Time had gone on; the crowd had cheered at sight of
him, and Gilles had gradually been lulled into a semblance
of security.  Then suddenly, from the far end of the
balcony, some fifty paces away, there came the sound of an
usher's voice calling in stentorian tones:
</p>

<p>
'Make room for Madame Jacqueline de Broyart, Duchesse
et Princesse de Ramèse, d'Espienne et de Wargny!  Make
room!'
</p>

<p>
And down the vista of the long terrace, he caught sight
of Jacqueline advancing towards him between the avenue
of lilies.  She was dressed in a white satin gown, and she
had pearls round her neck and in her hair.  The April
sun fell full upon her, and the soft breeze blew the tendrils
of her hair, like strands of gold, about her face.  With a
sinking of the heart, Gilles saw that she walked with a weary
and listless step; but she held herself very erect, with head
slightly thrown back, looking straight out before her as
she came.  A mask of black satin hid her face, but even
though he could not see those heavenly blue eyes of hers,
Gilles had realized in a moment that his beloved knew
everything.
</p>

<p>
An access of wellnigh savage rage sent the hot blood
up to his head.  For the space of one second everything
around him took on a blood-red hue, and he turned on
d'Inchy with convulsed fingers, prepared to grip him by
the throat.  Already the cry 'You miserable scoundrel!'
hovered on his lips....  Then he checked himself.  What
was the good?  D'Inchy had acted rightly, in accordance
with his own lights.  He wished to make sure that the
Valois Prince, who had broken so many promises in his
life, should at least on this one occasion be irrevocably
fettered.  The assembled dignitaries, the crowd down below,
the whole city of Cambray should witness the solemn
plighting of his troth.  And Jacqueline&mdash;the unfortunate,
innocent pawn in all these intrigues&mdash;should be the one whose
weak, small hands would hold him indissolubly to his bond.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of tense silence.  Gilles could hear
his own heart beating in his breast.  He had of a truth
ceased to feel and to think.  The situation was so hopeless
now, so stupendous, that it was beyond human power to
grapple with.  He hardly felt that he was alive; a kind
of greyish veil had interposed itself between his eyes and
that group of solemn Flemish worthies around him.  And
through that veil he could see their podgy faces, red and
round, and grinning at him with great cavern-like mouths,
and eyes that darted fierce flames upon him.  Of a truth,
he thought that he was going mad, had a wild desire to
throw back his head and to laugh&mdash;laugh loudly and long;
laugh for ever at the discomfiture of some fool who was
standing there in his&mdash;Gilles de Crohin's&mdash;shoes; at that
fool who had thought to carry through a long farce unchecked,
and who presently would be unmasked by the very woman
whom he loved, and driven forth under opprobrium and
ignominy into an outer world, where he could never look
an honest man in the face again.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he would have laughed&mdash;for the muscles round
his mouth were itching till they ached&mdash;only that, just
then, in the very midst of the crowd below, he caught sight
of de Landas' mocking glance&mdash;de Landas, who had been
in the Council Room awhile ago, and who apparently had
since mixed with the crowd for the sole purpose of
witnessing his successful rival's discomfiture.  This seemed to
stiffen him suddenly, to drag him back from out that
whirlpool of wild sensations wherein he was floundering, and
which was bowling him along, straight to dementia.
</p>

<p>
'No, my friend Gilles!' he said to himself.  'Since
you are to die dishonoured, at least die like a man.  Not
before all these people; not before that man who hates
you, not before that woman who loves you, shall you flinch
in the face of Destiny.  You have played many ignoble
parts these days; do not now play that of a coward!'
</p>

<p>
And he stood quietly there, still picturesque and magnificent,
still defying Fate which had played him this last,
desperate trick, while Monseigneur advanced to Jacqueline,
took her hand and said aloud in measured tones of ceremony,
so that every one there might hear:
</p>

<p>
'My dear Jacqueline, it is with inexpressible joy that
mine old eyes behold this happy hour.  <i>Monsieur</i> Duc
d'Anjou et d'Alençon, Prince of the House of France, hath
asked your hand in marriage.  We, your guardians, do
but await your consent to this union which we had planned
for the great good of our beloved country.  Say the word,
my dear Jacqueline, and I myself will proclaim to our poor,
sorrowing people the joyful news that a Liberator hath come
to them at last, and that the United Provinces of the
Netherlands may look to him as their Sovereign Lord and
King.'
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline had listened to Monseigneur's peroration with
perfect composure.  She stood then not ten paces away
from Gilles&mdash;the only woman in the midst of all these men
who were gambling with her destiny.  Through her mask
she was looking on Gilles, and on him only, feeling that
the whole abyss of loathing, which filled her soul for him,
would be conveyed to him through her look.
</p>

<p>
She had believed in him so completely, trusted him so
implicitly, that now that she knew him to be both a liar
and a cheat, she felt that the very well-spring of her love
had turned to bitter hate.  And hate in a strong and sensitive
nature is at least as potent as love.  What the mystery
was wherewith he chose to surround himself, she did not
know.  What the object of the hideous comedy which he
had played could be, she hardly cared.  All that she knew
was that he had cheated her and played her false, stolen
her love from her to suit some political intrigue of which he
held the threads&mdash;helped in any case in a hideous and clumsy
deception which would leave her for ever shamed.
</p>

<p>
But now she knew just what she had to do.  She might
have unmasked the deception last night, told Monseigneur
the truth and opened his eyes to the stupid fraud that was
perpetrated upon him.  What stopped her from doing that
she did not know.  Perhaps she still hoped that something
would occur that would give a simple explanation of the
difficult puzzle.  Perhaps she thought that when she would
be brought face to face with the man who was impersonating
the Duc d'Anjou, that man would prove to be some low
impostor, but not her knight&mdash;not the man who had held
her in his arms and sworn that his love for her was as
pure as that of the lark for the sun.  And if, indeed, she
had been so hideously deceived, if her idol prove to have
not only feet of clay but heart of stone and soul of darkness,
then she would unmask him, publicly, daringly, before the
entire people of Cambray, humiliate him so utterly that his
very name would become a by-word for all that was
ignominious and base, and find some solace for her misery in
the satisfaction of seeing him brought to shame.
</p>

<p>
Therefore Jacqueline had said nothing last night to
Monseigneur&mdash;nothing this morning.  When requested by her
guardian to prepare for this day's ceremony, she had obeyed
without a word.  Now she listened to his speech until the
end.  After which, she said calmly:
</p>

<p>
'Like yourself, Monseigneur, I am covered with confusion
at thought of the great honour which a Prince of the House
of France will do to our poor country.  I would wish, with
your permission, to express my deep respect for him ere I
place my hand in his.'
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Monseigneur stood a little to one side, so
that Jacqueline and Gilles remained directly facing one
another.  Every one was watching the young pair, and
kindly murmurs of approval at the beauty of the girl, and
the martial bearing of the man, flew from mouth to mouth.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline, stately and dignified as was her wont, advanced
a step or two.  Then she said slowly:
</p>

<p>
'And is it of a truth <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon
who stands before me now?'
</p>

<p>
She looked straight at him, and he in imagination saw
beneath the mask which hid the expression of her face&mdash;saw
those blue eyes which had looked on him yesterday
with such ineffable tenderness; saw those exquisite lips
which had murmured words of infinite love.  An utter
loathing overcame him of the part which he had to play,
of the fraud which was to deliver his beloved into the
keeping of a worthless reprobate.  He was conscious only
of a wild desire to throw himself at her feet in an agony
of remorse and repentance, to kiss her gown, the tips of
her velvet shoes; and then to proclaim the truth, to put
it for ever out of that profligate Prince's power to claim
this exquisite woman as his bride&mdash;to proclaim the truth,
and then to run away like a second Cain, from the scene
of an unforgivable crime; to flee like the treacherous
soldier who hath deserted the citadel; to flee, leaving behind
him the tattered rag of France's honour lying for ever soiled
in the dust, beneath the feet of a duped and credulous
nation.
</p>

<p>
Just then she put out her hand&mdash;that perfect hand,
which he had held in his and which to his touch had seemed
like the petal of a flower, and she said, with the same solemn
deliberation:
</p>

<p>
'Is it in truth to the Duc d'Anjou himself that I herewith
plight my troth?'
</p>

<p>
The avowal was on Gilles' lips.
</p>

<p>
'Madame&mdash;&mdash;' he began, and looked unflinchingly,
straightforwardly at her.
</p>

<p>
But before he could speak another word, a cry suddenly
rang out&mdash;shrill and terrifying&mdash;out of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
'Do not touch him, Madame!  Do not touch him!
He is not the Duc d'Anjou!  He is an impostor and a liar!
A Spanish spy!  Beware!!'
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur, the city fathers, the Mayor&mdash;every one on
La Bretèque, in fact&mdash;gasped with horror.  How dared
these abominable agitators mar the beauty of this affecting
ceremony?  Monseigneur went forward, leaned over the
balustrade in order to try and ascertain who it was who
was trying to create a disturbance.  He saw de Landas
down below in the midst of the throng, vaguely wondered
what the young commandant was doing there, when his
place was up on La Bretèque amongst those of his own
rank.  Anyway, he spoke to de Landas, shouted himself
hoarse to make the young man hear, for an unpleasant
turmoil had followed that first cry of 'Spanish spy'&mdash;people
were shouting and gesticulating and the call 'Down with
him!' came repeatedly from several points in the rear of
the crowd.
</p>

<p>
De Landas looked up, but he pretended not to hear,
laughed and shrugged his shoulders, as if the matter did
not concern him.  And yet there was no mistaking the
persistence with which that ominous cry 'Spanish spy!'
was taken up again and again, nor the disturbing effect
which it had upon the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur then tried to harangue the mob, to point
out to them the evil of their ways.  Had they forgotten
that they were out to enjoy themselves, to forget their
troubles, to forget the very fact that the words 'Spaniard'
and 'Spanish' existed in their lexicon.  But Messire de
Landas' paid agents would not let him speak.  They had
been paid to create a disturbance, not to let the people stand
about placidly, listening to windy harangues.
</p>

<p>
So, the moment Monseigneur opened his mouth, the whole
gang of them took up the provocative cry: 'A Spanish
spy!  Take care, Madame Jacqueline!' until it was
repeated over and over again by numberless voices, hoarse
with excitement and with spite.  The crowd oscillated as
if driven by a sudden blast; ominous murmurs came from
those points where women and men stood in compact and
sullen groups.
</p>

<p>
'Spanish spy!  Beware!' rang out again and again.
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur the governor was in a wild state of agitation.
He could not understand what it was that had set some
rowdy malcontents to disturb the peaceful serenity of this
eventful morning.  Unable to make himself heard, he turned
in helpless bewilderment to Gilles.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur,' he began, in a voice quivering with
consternation.  'I do entreat you...'
</p>

<p>
But he got no further.  Above this peroration, above
the shuffling and the mutterings of his friends on the
balcony, above the cries and murmurs down below, there had
suddenly resounded the dull boom of distant cannon.  The
crowd gave one terrific, full-throated roar of terror:
</p>

<p>
'The Spaniards!  They are on us!'
</p>

<p>
And in the seething mass of humanity on the Grand'
Place could be seen just that awful, ominous swaying which
precedes a stampede.  Already the women screamed and
some men shouted: 'Sauve qui peut!'
</p>

<p>
'The Spanish spy!' cried a voice.  'What did I tell
you, citizens?  He hath taken advantage of this holiday
to bring the Spaniards about your ears!'
</p>

<p>
Now the swaying of the crowd became like a tidal wave
upon the bosom of the ocean.  Hundreds of men and women
and little children started to move, not in one direction
but in several, like frightened sheep who know not whither
to go.  Yells and screams, some of rage others of terror,
rose in a wild tumult from below.  And through it all a few
persistent voices&mdash;recognizable by the well-known guttural
tone peculiar to those of Spanish blood&mdash;shouted themselves
hoarse with the persistent cry: 'The Spaniards are on us!
We are betrayed!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VI
</h4>

<p>
Monseigneur the governor, unable to make himself heard,
helpless and gravely perturbed, hurried into the Council
Room, and after him trooped the city fathers like a flock
of scared hens.  Confusion at once reigned inside the Town
Hall as much as out on the Place&mdash;a confusion that could
be felt rather than heard, a dull murmur of voices, a
scurrying and pattering of feet.
</p>

<p>
Once more the cannon roared, and the weird sound was
followed by a prolonged volley of musket shot.
</p>

<p>
'They are on us!  Sauve qui peut!'
</p>

<p>
Then, suddenly, far away in the direction of Cantimpré,
a huge column of smoke rose to the sky.  It was immediately
followed by a stupendous report which literally shook the
ground beneath the feet of this terror-stricken mass of
humanity.  A shower of broken glass fell at several points
with a loud clatter on to the pavements below, and in
absolutely wild and unreasoning terror, the crowd began to push
and to jostle, to drive, and shove, and batter anything or
any one that came in the way.  Men and women in their
terror had become like a herd of stampeding beasts, tearing
at every obstacle, hurling maledictions and missiles, fighting,
pushing, to get back to their homes, hammering at doors
that had already been hastily barred and bolted, by those
who happened to have found shelter inside the houses close
by.
</p>

<p>
'They are on us!  Sauve qui peut!'
</p>

<p>
This time it was a company of the city guard, who came
running helter-skelter from the direction of the Citadel,
halbertmen and pikemen, most of them unarmed, others
with their steel bonnets set awry upon their heads, not a
few leaving a trail of blood behind them as they ran.
</p>

<p>
'Sauve qui peut!'  The deathly call of the runaway
soldier, the most awesome sound the ear of man can hear.
And over from St. Géry came others running too, the archers
from Notre Dame, and on the right there were the gunners
from Seille.  They were running; like hunted deer, swiftly,
panting, their jerkins torn, the slashings of their doublets
hanging on them in strips.
</p>

<p>
They added the final horrible note of hopelessness to
the terror and the confusion.  From every corner of the
city there rose cries of distress, shrill screams from women
and children, loud curses from the men.  The very air
was filled with these dismal sounds, whilst the Unseen
which was happening somewhere upon the ramparts of
the city, appeared vastly more terrifying than the Seen.
</p>

<p>
And, far away, the cannon still roared and columns of
fire and smoke rose with lurid significance to the sky.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VII
</h4>

<p>
And yet it had all occurred within a very few minutes.
Gilles and Jacqueline were left alone now on La Bretèque,
and neither of them had thought of fleeing.  For each of
them the awesome moment was just a pause wherein their
minds faced the only important problem&mdash;how to help
and what to do, singly, against that terrible tide.
</p>

<p>
It was just a moment&mdash;the space, perhaps, of a dozen
heart-beats.  All around them the turbulent passions of
men&mdash;fear, enmity, greed&mdash;were raging in all their unbridled
frenzy.  The cannons roared, the walls of the ancient city
tottered; but they stood in a world apart, he&mdash;the man
who unknowingly had played so ignominious a part&mdash;and
she, the woman whom he had so heinously wronged.  He
tried to read her innermost thoughts behind that forbidding
mask, and a mad appeal to her for forgiveness rose, even
at this supreme instant, to his lips.
</p>

<p>
But the appeal was never made.  The man's feelings,
his grief, his shame were all swept aside by the stirring of
the soldier's soul.  It was the moment when first the cannon
roared and the runaway guard came running through the
streets, Gilles saw them long before they had reached
the Grand' Place.  He realized what it all meant, saw the
unutterable confusion and panic which would inevitably
render the city an easy prey to the invader.  He gave a
cry of horror and dismay.
</p>

<p>
'My God! but 'tis black treachery that has been at
work this day!' he exclaimed involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
She had not yet seen the runaway guard, did not perhaps
for the moment realize the utter imminence of the peril.
Her mind was still busy with the difficult problem&mdash;how to
help, what to do.  But his involuntary cry suddenly roused
her ire and her bitter disillusionment.
</p>

<p>
'You should know Messire,' she retorted.  'You are
well versed in the art.'
</p>

<p>
'God forgive me, I am!' he ejaculated ruefully.  'But
this!' he added with a smothered oath, and pointed down
to the panic-stricken soldiers.  'This! ... Oh, my God!
Your safety, your precious life at stake!  You'll not believe,
Jacqueline,' he pleaded, 'that I had a hand in selling your
city to your enemies?'
</p>

<p>
'In selling the city!'  The words appeared to have
whipped up her spirit as with a lash.  She looked at him,
wrathfully, boldly, with a still unspoken challenge lurking
in her eyes.  'You do not believe that&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That traitors have engineered her perdition?' he broke
in rapidly.  'I do!'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'The disturbance in the crowd ... the panic ... the
deserters ... those abominable agitators!  In a few hours
the Spaniards will be inside the city&mdash;and Cambray lost!'
</p>

<p>
'Cambray lost!  Impossible!'
</p>

<p>
'With no discipline, no leaders....  She cannot
resist&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Then you must lead her,' she said firmly.
</p>

<p>
'I?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes!  You!'
</p>

<p>
She had taken the mask from off her face and confronted
him now with a glowing challenge in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
'You!' she reiterated, speaking very rapidly.  'Whoever
you are, save Cambray ... defend her ... save
her!  I know that you can.'
</p>

<p>
In the look which she gave him he read something which
filled his very soul with rapture.  He gave her back glance
for glance, worship for this trust.
</p>

<p>
'I can at any rate die for her,' he said quietly.  'If
you, ma donna, will forgive.'
</p>

<p>
'Save Cambray,' she reiterated with superb confidence,
'and I'll forgive everything!'
</p>

<p>
'Then may God have you in His keeping,' he called to
her.  And, before she could realize what was in his purpose,
he had climbed to the top of the tall balustrade, stood for
one moment there high above her, silhouetted against the
clear blue of the sky, like a living statue of youth and
enthusiasm and springtide, animated by that faith which
moveth mountains and sets out to conquer the world in
order to lay it at the loved one's feet.
</p>

<p>
'Jehan!' he called.  'À moi!'
</p>

<p>
Then, swinging himself with the easy grace of perfect
strength, he jumped down on to the perron below.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
WHILE TRAITORS ARE AT WORK
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
And now, I pray you think of Jacqueline running to
the balustrade and, with glowing eyes looking over
the stonework upon the perron beneath her.  Jehan has
caught his master as the latter touches the ground, and
for the space of two or three seconds the two men stand
at the top of the steps, locked in each other's arms, steadying
one another.  During those few seconds Messire whispers
hurriedly in his faithful henchman's ears:
</p>

<p>
'De Balagny's troops from La Fère ... at all costs....
Understand?'
</p>

<p>
Jehan nods.
</p>

<p>
'Tell them to attack from the Bapaume Road, with as
much clatter and shouting as may be.  We'll hold on till
they come.  Go!'
</p>

<p>
He waits another few seconds until he sees Jehan's burly
form disappear through the throng, then with a loud call,
'À moi! all you citizens of Cambray who are not cowards
and traitors!' he draws his sword and faces the crowd.
</p>

<p>
He has a clear and resonant voice, which rises above the
tumult.  The panic-stricken throng of men and women
pause mechanically in their unconsidered flight, to look
on that strange apparition on the perron steps&mdash;strange,
in truth; for towering up there, he looks preternaturally
tall, and the black mask on his face gives him an air of
mystery.
</p>

<p>
'Citizens of Cambray,' he continues lustily.  'The
Spaniard is at your gate!  Are you going to let the traitors
have their day?'
</p>

<p>
The crowd sways towards him.  Frightened as every one
is, there is a momentary lull in the wild stampede, while
scared, wide-eyed, pallid faces are turned towards the
stranger.  The runaway soldiers, too, pause, in their
headlong rush.  A company of pikemen stand in a compact
group on the edge of the crowd, some fifty paces away from
Gilles.  Their captain, bonnetless, with tattered jerkin and
face streaming with sweat, is in their midst.  Messire sees
him, and shouts to him with all his might.
</p>

<p>
'Captain of the guard, Cambray is in peril!  What are
you doing here?'
</p>

<p>
The man evidently wavers; he looks shamed and overcome,
tries to hide himself behind his subordinates.  But
some one close at his elbow&mdash;Jacqueline cannot see who it
is&mdash;appears to egg him on, and after an instant's hesitation
he says sullenly:
</p>

<p>
'The Spaniards are on us, and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Then why are you not on the Spaniards?' retorts Gilles.
</p>

<p>
'They have made a breach at Cantimpré.'
</p>

<p>
'Then where are your counter-mines?'
</p>

<p>
'Under the bastion.'
</p>

<p>
'Did you fire them?'
</p>

<p>
'No.  The whole fort is crumbling already.  It would
tumble about our ears.'
</p>

<p>
'Then why are you not at the breach to make a rampart
of your body?'
</p>

<p>
Again the man wavers.  He is a soldier and a tried one,
appears bewildered at his own act of treachery.  It seemed
at the time as if some one&mdash;some devil&mdash;had put cowardice
into his heart at the very moment when courage and presence
of mind were most urgently needed.  The men, too, had
faltered, broken most unexpectedly at the first assault,
throwing down their arms.  Even the gunners....  But
it wouldn't bear thinking of.  In truth, some devil had
been at work, is at work now; for when the men and the
captain, already stirred by Gilles' enthusiasm, looking
ashamed and crestfallen, are on the point of cheering, a
peremptory voice, laden with spite, rises from somewhere
in the rear.
</p>

<p>
'Captain of the guard!  I forbid you to listen to this
man!  He is a cheat and an impostor!'
</p>

<p>
It is de Landas, who, hidden at the back of the crowd,
has seen Gilles jump down from the balcony, and scenting
danger to his infamous scheme, has been at pains to force
his way to the forefront of the mob.  It has taken him some
time and vigorous play of the elbows, for the crowd has
become interested in the masked stranger&mdash;in the man whom
they had nearly murdered twenty-four hours ago, but whose
appearance and words to-day are distinctly inspiriting and
reassuring.
</p>

<p>
De Landas has one of his favourite familiars with him&mdash;the
Fleming, Maarege&mdash;and together the two men stand
now, commanding and arrogant, in front of the soldiers
and their captain.  And they, recognizing the chief
commandant of the garrison, are once more panic-stricken and
dumb.  Vague ideas of discipline and punishment, to which
the young Spaniard had accustomed them, check their
enthusiasm for the stranger.
</p>

<p>
Now de Landas has taken a step or two nearer to the
captain of the guard.  His eyes are aflame with fury, and
his whole attitude is one of authority and of menace.
</p>

<p>
'If you dare parley with this man,' he says savagely,
'you will answer for it with your life.  The Spanish armies
are at your gates; in a few hours they will be in this city.
Your only hope of pardon for yourself, for your wife, your
children and your kindred, lies in complete and immediate
surrender to the will of His Majesty the King of Spain, my
master and yours!'
</p>

<p>
'To hell with the King of Spain, your master!' Gilles'
stentorian voice breaks in from above.  'Soldiers of
Cambray!' he continues lustily, 'You have nothing to fear
from the King of Spain, or from any of his minions!  'Tis
you who will punish them for all their past insolence!  You
who will dictate to them the terms of victory!'
</p>

<p>
'You miserable varlet!' exclaims de Landas, and turns
on Gilles with unbridled savagery.  'How dare you raise
your voice when the King of Spain speaks through my
lips?  How dare you speak to all these besotted fools of
victory, when in submission lies their only chance of safety?
Fools!' he goes on, and turns once more to the crowd.
'Self-deluded dupes!  Do you not feel the might of Spain
closing in upon you?  Surrender, I say!  Submit!  You
are wretched and starved and weak.  You cannot defend
yourselves, and no one will come to your aid.'
</p>

<p>
'Then do I proclaim you a liar, M. de Landas!' is
Gilles' firm retort.  'The armies of France are on their
way for the relief of Cambray, even at this hour.'
</p>

<p>
'It is false!'
</p>

<p>
'True as I live.  True as that you are a miserable traitor!
True as there is a Heaven above us and as there are angels
who visit this earth.  Citizens of Cambray, I swear to you
that the army of the King of France will be outside your
city before the April sun that smiles upon your valour has
sunk down to rest.  So give a cheer for France, citizens of
Cambray!  France, your deliverer and friend!'
</p>

<p>
His sally is greeted with a gigantic outburst of
cheering.
</p>

<p>
'France!  France!'
</p>

<p>
The crowd has listened spellbound while the masked
stranger bandied words with that bastard Spaniard, whom
they had all learned to loathe long ago.  His cheery voice,
his confident bearing, his exultation, have already warmed
their hearts.  Something of their terror has vanished;
they are no longer like a herd of awestruck beasts, driven
aimlessly along by senseless terror.  There is nothing in the
world so infectious as fear, except courage and enthusiasm:
and Gilles' martial figure, the proud carriage of his head,
his vibrant voice and flashing sword, are there to infuse
valour even in the most abject.
</p>

<p>
The captain of the guard and his men had winced before
de Landas' threats.  Old habits of discipline could not all
in a moment be shaken off.  But now they feel that the
crowd is at one with them in their enthusiasm for the
stranger, and also that they will be given a chance of
retrieving their shameful act of cowardice of awhile ago.  So,
when the crowd cheers, the soldiers, despite de Landas'
black looks and his brutal menaces, following their captain's
lead, cheer too.  They cheer until the very walls of the
ancient city reverberate with the sound.
</p>

<p>
'France!  France!'
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly Gilles, at the top of the perron steps,
quick as lightning, runs to the nearest earthenware pot
which is filled with the Madonna lilies.  He plucks out a
sheaf of the flowers, and with a loud cry: 'Soldiers of
Cambray, rally to the standard of France!  To the
unconquered Flower o' the Lily!' he throws the flowers one
by one to the soldiers and their captain.  The men seize
them as they fly through the air and fasten them to their
bonnets or their belts.  The crowd acclaims the spirited deed:
</p>

<p>
'Long live the flower o' the lily!' they shout.
</p>

<p>
Now Gilles is running from pot to pot.  He snatches
sheaf after sheaf of lilies and throws them to the crowd.
The flowers are caught up with ever growing ardour, whilst
every corner of the Place rings with the triumphant call:
'France!  France!'
</p>

<p>
Far away the cannon is roaring, the air is rent with the
sharp report of muskets and the crumbling of masonry.
The translucent April sky hath taken on a lurid hue.  Around
the city walls the brutal enemy is already swarming; he
is battering at the gates, has climbed the fortifications,
run triumphantly to the assault.  Awhile ago the crowd
had cowered at the sound, fled terrified at his approach.
Now every heart is thrilled with fervour, every soul responds
to the appeal of an enthusiast, and is glowing with the hope
of victory.
</p>

<p>
And de Landas, blind with fury, sees the fruits of his
abominable treachery crumbling to dust before his eyes.
He glowers on every one around him like a stricken bull,
with rage and frenzy enkindled in his eyes.  And suddenly,
before any one there can guess his purpose, he has laid savage
hands on the Captain of the guard, and drawing a pistol
from his belt he points it at the unfortunate man's breast.
</p>

<p>
'If one of you dares to utter another sound, or to stir
from this spot,' he shrieks out in a shrill and husky voice,
'I'll shoot this dog where he stands.'
</p>

<p>
At once the cheers immediately near him are stilled, a
groan of horror and of execration rises from an hundred
throats, and for the space of a few seconds the soldiers
stand quite still, holding their breath; for in truth it is
murder which gleams out of the young Spaniard's eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Down on your knees, you miscreant!' shouts de Landas
fiercely.  'Maarege, à moi!  Help me to make a clean
sweep of this herd of rebels.  Down on your knees, every
one of you!  You Flemish swine!'
</p>

<p>
'Down on your knees, M. le Marquis!' Gilles' sonorous
voice rings out like a bronze bell beneath the clapper.
With that rapidity which characterizes his every action,
he runs down the perron steps, catches de Landas' right
arm from behind and gives it such a brutal wrench that
the pistol falls from the miscreant's hand and the Spaniard
himself, sick with the pain, comes down on one knee.
</p>

<p>
'Out of the way, you hell-hound!' Gilles goes on
mercilessly.  'There is no room for traitors in Cambray.'
</p>

<p>
He kicks the pistol on one side and throws de Landas,
semi-inert, from him, as if he were a bale of noisome goods.
Then he turns and, with an instantaneous gesture, has
gripped de Landas' familiar by the throat.
</p>

<p>
'I'll kill every one of your gang with mine own hands,'
he says in a fierce and rapid whisper, 'unless you all slink
away at once like the curs that you are!'
</p>

<p>
The words are hardly out of his mouth, and Maarege,
faint and sick, is bending under that powerful grip, when
from somewhere overhead there comes a sudden,
heart-rending cry of warning.
</p>

<p>
'Take care!'
</p>

<p>
But the warning has come just a second too late.  De
Landas, recovering from semi-consciousness, has succeeded
in crawling on hands and knees and retaking possession of
his pistol.  He points it straight at his hated rival.  There
is a sharp report, followed by screams from the women.
For a second or two Gilles remains standing just where he
was, with his sinewy fingers round Maarege's throat.  Then
his grip relaxes; Maarege totters back, panting and half
dead, whilst Gilles instinctively puts his hand to his shoulder.
His jerkin is already deeply stained with blood.
</p>

<p>
De Landas gives an almost demoniacal shout of glee,
which, however, is but short-lived.  The soldiers, who had
been cowed by his brutality a moment ago, are roused to
a passion of fury now at the dastardly assault on one who
has already become their idol.  They fall on the recreant,
regardless of his rank and power.  They drag him up from
the ground, wrench the pistol out of his hand and hold him
there, a panting, struggling, impotent beast, breathing
hatred and malediction.
</p>

<p>
'Give the word, Monseigneur,' the Captain says coolly,
'and we'll kill the vermin.'  He holds the pistol to de
Landas' breast, whilst his eyes are fixed on Gilles, waiting
for the order to fire.
</p>

<p>
'Let the serpent be, captain,' Gilles replies quietly.
</p>

<p>
'But you are hurt, Monseigneur,' the captain urges.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing but a scratch&mdash;'tis healed already.'
</p>

<p>
Far away the cannon thunders once more.  Once more a
terrific explosion rends the air.  Gilles, still upright, still
cheery, still brimful of enthusiasm, holds his sword up high
over his head, so that the April sun draws sparks of fire
from its shining blade.
</p>

<p>
'To the breach, friends!' he cries.  'If breach there
be!  À moi, soldiers of Cambray!  Form into line and to
the ramparts!  I'll be there before you!  And you, proud
citizens of a valiant city, à moi!  Pick up your staves and
your sticks, your chisels and your rakes!  À moi!  All of
you, with your fists and your knees and your hearts and your
minds!  Remember Mons, and Mechlin and Gand!  Remember
your hearths! your wives! your daughters! and
let the body of each one of you here be a living rampart
against the foe for the defence of your homes.  À moi!'
</p>

<p>
The captain gives the order, the men fall in, in straight,
orderly line.  On their bonnets or in their belts the white
lily gleams like shining metal beneath the kiss of the April
sun.  From the Town Hall the bodyguard comes trooping
down the perron steps.  They are joined by the halberdiers
who had lined the Grand' Place, by the archers from
St. Géry and the musketeers from the citadel.  The banners
of the city guilds flutter in the breeze; fair hands and
white kerchiefs are waved from windows and balconies
above, and a terrific cheer for France rends the air with
its triumphant echo, as the crowd begins to move slowly
in the wake of the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
'Long live France!'
</p>

<p>
'Long live the Defender of Cambray!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
For a moment Gilles stands quite still, almost isolated
where he is, a little dizzy with excitement and with loss of
blood.  An uncomfortable veil is fast gathering in front of
his eyes.  'I shall have to see to this stupid scratch,' he
murmurs to himself.
</p>

<p>
It had all occurred so quickly&mdash;within a brief quarter
of an hour.  And yet the destinies of nations had been recast
during that time.  Now the city fathers, the provosts,
Monseigneur himself, are crowding round the one man who
they feel might still save them from dishonour.
</p>

<p>
'Your Highness, we look to you,' Monseigneur is saying.
</p>

<p>
'Tell us what you wish done,' adds the Chief Magistrate.
</p>

<p>
'The Provosts await your Highness' orders,' rejoins a
pompous dignitary, whilst yet another continues in the
same strain: 'We are body and soul at your Highness'
commands.'
</p>

<p>
Their voices come to Gilles as if from somewhere far away.
They are drowned by the tumult of the beleaguered city
preparing for a last stand.  But the instinct of the soldier
keeps him steadfast on his feet.  He makes a violent effort
to keep his head clear and his voice firm.  He gives orders
to the Chief Magistrate, the Provosts, the Mayors of the
Guilds.  The forts must be visited at once, the men
encouraged, the officers admonished.  Every hour, every minute
almost is now of priceless value.  The troop brought
over by Messire de Balagany, encamped at La Fère
cannot be here before sundown.  Until then the men must
stand.  Oh! they must stand, Messires!  Despite crumbling
walls and hecatombs of dead!  Let the men know that
the existence of their country is hanging to-day by a thread!
</p>

<p>
The Guild of Armourers must open up its stores: pikes,
lances, halberts, muskets, must be distributed to a
contingent of citizens, who, though untrained, will help to
strengthen the living wall.  The Guild of Apothecaries
must be ready with ambulances and dressings, and
stretcher-bearers must work wonders so that the fighters are not
encumbered by the dead.
</p>

<p>
The Chief Engineer of the city must see to barricading
the streets with double rows of hurdles, or boxes, or
furniture, or lumber of any sorts, with sacks filled with earth,
empty carts, wagons, clothing, anything and everything
that may be handy.  The reservoirs of the city must be
patrolled, and if it be deemed necessary, they must be opened
and the water allowed to flood the low-lying streets by the
river, if the enemy succeed in obtaining a foothold there.
Countermines must be laid; every one must to his task,
and he who does not fight must think and work and endure.
</p>

<p>
Every one obeys.  One by one, the dignitaries file away
to execute the orders which have been given them.  They
all accept the leadership of this man, whom they still believe
to be the Duc d'Anjou, their future Sovereign Lord.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Monseigneur!' exclaims d'Inchy warmly.  'I
thank God on my knees that you are with us to-day, and
that it is you who will defend our city&mdash;the most precious
pearl in your future inheritance.'
</p>

<p>
'Your Highness must save yourself as much as possible,'
comes in cordial echo from M. de Lalain.  'We could ill
spare you now.'
</p>

<p>
'What would we do if Monseigneur fell?' adds another.
</p>

<p>
And then an angelic voice breaks in suddenly, saying
with sweet compassion:
</p>

<p>
'Fie, Monsieur my guardian, to weary Monseigneur so!
Cannot you see that he is fainting?'
</p>

<p>
But Gilles hardly hears.  Tired nature is asserting her
rights over him at last.  He sinks wearied upon the nearest
step.  It seems to him as if soft arms are thrown around
him, whilst others&mdash;more powerful and insistent&mdash;busy
themselves dexterously with his jerkin.
</p>

<p>
It is all very vague and infinitely sweet.  Soft linen
is laid upon his wounded shoulder, something pungent and
sweet-smelling is held to his nostrils, whilst from very far
away, in the regions of dreams and of paradise, a soft voice
murmurs with angelic solicitude:
</p>

<p>
'Think you it will heal?'
</p>

<p>
'Very quickly, gracious lady,' a gruff voice replies.
''Tis only a flesh wound.  Excitement hath brought on a
brief swoon.  It is nothing.'
</p>

<p>
After which Gilles remembers nothing more.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
THE DEFENCE OF CAMBRAY
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Of that terrible day in Cambray, that fourth of April,
1581, nothing has survived but a memory&mdash;a glowing
memory of fervour and enthusiasm, of reckless disregard
of danger and magnificent deeds of valour; a heartrending
memory of sorrow and misery and death.
</p>

<p>
Five times in as many hours did the armies of the Duke
of Parma rush to the assault of the city.  Five times did a
living rampart of intrepid bodies interpose itself between
the mighty hordes and the crumbling walls of Cambray&mdash;those
intrepid bodies more steadfast than the walls.  At
one hour after noon the redoubt of Cantimpré is a black
mass of charred débris, the Château de Seille is in flames.
On the right bank of the Scheldt the walls have a breach
through which twenty men can pass, the moats and the
river are filled with dead.
</p>

<p>
But the living rampart still stands.  The walls of Cambray
are crumbling, but her citizens are steadfast.  Halbertmen
and pikemen, archers and gunners, they all have a moment's
weakness to retrieve, and do it with deeds of indomitable
valour.  And as they fall, and their numbers become thinned,
as that breathing, palpitating wall sustains shock after
shock of the most powerful engines of warfare the world
has ever known, its gaps are made good by other breasts
and other hearts, and with all the spirit which will not rest
until it has conquered.
</p>

<p>
Outside and in, at this hour, all is confusion.  A medley
of sights and sounds which the senses cannot wholly grasp,
dull roar of cannon, sharp retort of musketry, clash of pike
and lance and halbert, the terrified shrieks of women and
the groans of the wounded and the dying.  Round about
the walls, in the narrow streets and up on the battlements,
a litter of broken steel and staves, of scrap-iron and
fragments of masonry and glass, torn jerkins cast aside; for
the April sun is hot and the smell of powder goes to the
head like wine.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
And from the tall steeples of Cambray's many churches
the tocsin sends its ominous call above the din.
</p>

<p>
Cambray is fighting for her liberty, for her existence.
Her sons and daughters are giving their lives for her.  And
not only for her, but for the Netherlands&mdash;the brave and
stricken country which has fought against such terrible odds
while the very centuries have rolled by.
</p>

<p>
A last stand, this; for no mercy is to be expected from
the Spaniard if he enters the city in his numbers.  Cambray
hath withstood the might of Philip II, hath rebelled against
his authority, hath dared to think that men are free to
think, to work and to worship, that children are not slaves
or women chattels.  Cambray hath unfurled the flag of
liberty.  If she fall, she becomes a prey to rapine and
brutality, to incendiaries and libertines.
</p>

<p>
So Cambray to-day must conquer or die.
</p>

<p>
Traitors have plotted against her, laid her open,
unsuspecting, to a surprise attack by an army which is
past-master in the art.  Caught unawares in a holiday mood,
she has flinched.  Worked upon by treachery, her sons
have wavered at first, panic seized hold of them&mdash;they all
but fell, shamed and destined to never-ending disgrace
and remorse.
</p>

<p>
But the cowardice had been momentary, fostered by past
months of privations and misery, fomented by the insidious
voice of traitors.  One man's voice hath rallied the sinking
spirits, one man's valour revived the dormant courage.
All they wanted was a leader&mdash;a man to tell them to
hope, a man to cheer and comfort them, to kindle in
their hearts the dying flame of indomitable will.  So, in
the wake of that man they have followed in their hundreds
and their thousands; the soldiers have regained discipline;
the men, courage; the women, resignation.  The masked
stranger whom they had been taught to hate, they have
already learned to worship.
</p>

<p>
Heroic, splendid, indomitable, he is the bulwark which
strengthens every faltering heart, the prop which supports
every wavering spirit.  From end to end of the ramparts
his sonorous voice vibrates and echoes, commanding,
helping, cheering.  If courage fails, he is there to stiffen;
if an arm tires, his is there to take its place.  Sword or
lance, or pike or halbert, culverine or musket or bow; every
weapon is familiar to his hand.  At the breach with a pistol,
on the ramparts with falconet, on the bastion with the heavy
cannon; he is here, there and everywhere where danger is
most threatening, where Spanish arrows darken the sky
like a storm-cloud that is wind-driven, and deal death when
they find their goal.  His jerkin is torn, the sleeve of his
doublet hangs tattered from his shoulder, his arm is bare,
his face black with powder and grime.  Around him the
Provosts and Sheriffs and Captains of the Guard vainly
beg him not to expose himself to unnecessary peril.
</p>

<p>
'The soldiers look to your Highness alone,' they cry in
desperation.  'If you fall, what should we do?'
</p>

<p>
They still believe him to be the Duc d'Anjou, brother of
the King of France, and marvel that so degenerate a race
could breed such a magnificent soldier.  He has said nothing
to disillusion them.  The mire of battle masks him better
than a scrap of satin or velvet, and whilst fighting
to save Cambray, he is also redeeming the honour of
France.
</p>

<p>
'If you fall, what should we do?' implores d'Inchy on
one occasion, during a lull in the attack.
</p>

<p>
Gilles laughs, loudly and long.  'Do?' he exclaims gaily.
'Hold Cambray to the last man and turn the Spaniard from
her walls!'
</p>

<p>
Unflinching and resolute, a pack of Flemish bourgeois
hold their ground against the might and main of the Duke
of Parma's magnificent army&mdash;clerks, some of them, others
shopkeepers or labourers, against the most powerful military
organization of the epoch!  But it is not only Cambray
that is threatened now; it is the freedom of their province
and the honour of their women.  And so they make a wall
of their bodies whilst the flower of the Duke of Parma's
hordes is hurled time after time against them.
</p>

<p>
Musketeers and crossbowmen, lancers and halberdiers&mdash;up
they come to the charge like an irresistible tidal wave
against a mighty cliff.  Like a torrent they rush over the
moat and on to the breach, or the bastions, or the ramparts;
attacking from every side, using every engine of warfare
which the mightiest kingdom of the age has devised for
the subjugation of rebellious cities.  The sound of
metal-headed arrows against the masonry is like a shower of
hailstones upon glass; the battlements gleam with flashing
steel, with sparks from brandished swords and flame-spitting
falconets.
</p>

<p>
Of a truth, the mind cannot grasp it all, eyes cannot
see nor ears perceive all the horrors, the misery and the
devotion.  Men fighting and women working to soothe,
to comfort or to heal.  Burghers' wives, humble maids,
great ladies, are all fighting with the men, fighting with
their hearts and their skilled hands, with clean bandages
and soothing potions, with words of comfort for the dying
and prayers for the dead.
</p>

<p>
In the streets behind the ramparts, rough ambulances
have been set up, mattresses dragged under sheds or
outhouses, fresh straw laid, on which the wounded might find
momentary solace.  The women, too, are doing their part.
Jacqueline de Broyart, one of the many, the most untiring
where all give of their best, the most selfless where all are
ready for sacrifice.  From time to time during the lull
between terrific assaults, she sees Gilles hurrying past&mdash;her
knight, the defender of her beloved city.  She bade him
go and save Cambray and sees him now, begrimed, in rags,
unheedful even of her, but cheerful and undaunted, certain
of victory.
</p>

<p>
'You will be proud, my dear,' says d'Inchy to her, during
one of those nerve-racking lulls, 'to place your hand in that
so valiant a soldier, to plight your troth to Monsieur Duc
d'Anjou.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall be proud,' she retorts simply, 'if, indeed, I might
plight my troth to the defender of Cambray.'
</p>

<p>
'The defender of Cambray, my dear,' rejoins d'Inchy
lustily.  'The saviour of Cambray, you mean!  'Tis on
our knees we shall have to thank him and offer him all
that we have of the best!'
</p>

<p>
A strange, elusive smile flits for a moment round Jacqueline's
mouth, and a look of infinite longing softens the light
of her blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
'If only it could be!' she sighs, and returns to her task.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Later in the afternoon, the picture becomes more clear.
We see the crumbling walls, the girdle around Cambray
falling away bit by bit; we see the breach at Cantimpré
wider by many feet now and a handful of men making a
last stand there, with muskets, crossbows, sticks&mdash;anything
that is ready to hand.  We see the bastions a mass of
smouldering ruins and the ramparts around on the point
of giving way.
</p>

<p>
And all about the city a mighty hecatomb&mdash;Spaniards
and Flemings, soldiers, burghers or churls, lie scattered
on the low-lying ground, in the moat, the ramparts or the
streets.  Might and glory have claimed their victims as
well as valour and worship of liberty.
</p>

<p>
Cambray's walls are falling.  The breach becomes wider
and wider every hour, like a huge gaping wound through
which the life-blood of the stricken city is oozing out drop
by drop.
</p>

<p>
But, guarding that breach, not yet yielding one foot of
the city which shelters his Jacqueline, Gilles de Crohin,
with that handful of men, still holds the ground.  His
anxious eyes scan the low horizon far away where the April
sun is slowly sinking to rest.  That way lies La Fère and
de Balagny's few picked men, whom Jehan has gone to
fetch, and who could even in this desperate hour turn Spanish
discomfiture into a rout.
</p>

<p>
'My God! why does Jehan tarry?' he calls out with
smouldering impatience.
</p>

<p>
Up on the battlements the guard stand firm; but the
Spaniards have succeeded in throwing several bridges of
pikes across the moat and one mine after another is laid
against the walls.  Captains and officers run to Gilles for
instructions or orders.
</p>

<p>
'There are no orders,' he says, 'save to hold out until
France comes to your aid.'
</p>

<p>
And out in the open country, outside those city walls
which hold together so much heroism and such indomitable
courage, the Duke of Parma, angered, fierce, terrible, has
rallied the cream of his armies around him.  The sixth
assault has just been repulsed, the breach cleared by a
terrific fusillade from that handful of men, whilst a
murderous shower from above, of granite and scrap-iron and
heavy stones, has scattered the attacking party.  A
fragment of stone has hit the Duke on the forehead; blood
is streaming down his face.  He sets spurs to his horse and
gallops to where a company of archers is scrambling
helter-skelter out of the moat.
</p>

<p>
'Cowards!' he cries savagely.  'Will you flee before
such rabble?'
</p>

<p>
He strikes at the soldiers with his sword, sets spurs to
his horse until the poor beast snorts with pain, rears and
paws the air with its hoofs, only to bring them down the
next moment, trampling and kicking half a dozen soldiers
to death in its mad and terrified struggle.
</p>

<p>
'You know the guard has fled,' Alexander Farnese cries
to his officers.  ''Tis only an undisciplined mob who is in
there now.'
</p>

<p>
His nephew, Don Miguel de Salvado, a brave and experienced
captain, shrugs his shoulders and retorts:
</p>

<p>
'A mob led by a man who has the whole art of warfare
at his finger-tips.  Look at him now!'
</p>

<p>
All eyes are turned in the direction to which Don Miguel
is pointing.  There, in the midst of smouldering ruins of
charred débris and crumbling masonry, stands the defender
of Cambray; behind him the graceful steeples of St. Géry
and of St. Waast, the towers of Notre Dame and of the Town
Hall, are lit up by the honey-coloured rays of the sinking
sun.  Superb in his tattered clothes, with chest and arms
bare, and ragged hose, he stands immovable, scanning the
western sky.
</p>

<p>
De Landas laughs aloud.
</p>

<p>
'He is still on the look-out for that promised help from
France,' he says, with a shrug of his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
The traitor has made good his escape out of the city
which he has betrayed.  What assistance he could render
to the Duke in the way of information, he has done.  The
measure of his infamy is full to the brim, and yet his hatred
for the enemy who has shamed him is in no way assuaged.
</p>

<p>
He, too, looks up and sees Gilles de Crohin, the man
whose invincible courage has caused the Spanish armies
so many valuable lives this day and such unforgettable
humiliation.
</p>

<p>
'A hundred doubloons,' he cries aloud, 'to the first
man who lays that scoundrel low!'
</p>

<p>
The word is passed from mouth to mouth.  The archers
and musketeers set up a cheer.  Parma adds, with an oath:
'And a captain's rank to boot!'
</p>

<p>
An hundred doubloons and a captain's rank!  'Tis a
fortune for any man.  It means retirement, a cottage in
sunny Spain, a home, a wife.  The men take heart and look
to their arrows and their muskets!  Every archer feels that
he has that fortune in his quiver now and every musketeer
has it in his powder horn.  And with a loud cry of 'Long
live King Philip of Spain!' the infantry once more rush
for the breach.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Don Miguel de Salvado leads the attack this time.  The
breach now looks like a gate which leads straight into the
heart of the city, where pillage and looting are to be the
reward of the conquerors; and the booty will be rich with
the precious belongings of a pack of overfed bourgeois.
</p>

<p>
That open gate for the moment seems undefended.  It is
encumbered with fallen masonry, and beyond this appear
piles of rubbish, overturned wagons, furniture, débris of
all sorts, evidently abandoned by the wretched inhabitants
when they fled from their homes.  Of Gilles de Crohin and
his burghers there is for the moment no sign.
</p>

<p>
Don Miguel has with him half a company of musketeers,
the finest known in Europe, and a company of lancers who
have been known to clear an entire city of rebels by their
irresistible onrush.
</p>

<p>
'No falling back, remember!' he commands.  'The
first who gives ground is a dead man!'
</p>

<p>
Up the lancers run on the slippery ground, clinging to
the wet earth with naked feet, to the coarse grass and loose
stones with their knees.  The musketeers remain on the
hither side of the moat, three deep in a long battle array;
the front lying flat upon the ground, the second kneeling,
the third standing, with their muskets levelled against the
first enemy who dares to show his face.  The pikemen have
reached the breach.  There is silence on the other side.  The
officer laughs lustily.
</p>

<p>
'I told you 'twas but a rabble playing with firearms!'
</p>

<p>
The words are hardly out of his mouth when a terrific
volley of musketry shakes the fast crumbling wall to its
foundation.  It comes from somewhere behind all those
débris&mdash;and not only from there, but from some other
unknown point, with death-like precision and cold deliberation.
The Spanish officer is hit in the face; twelve pikemen
throw up their arms and come rolling down on the wet
ground.
</p>

<p>
'What is this hell let loose?' cries the officer savagely,
ere he too, blinded with the flow of blood down his face,
beats a hasty retreat.
</p>

<p>
Quick! a messenger to His Highness the Duke of Parma!
The breach is so wide now that twenty men could walk
easily through it.  The enemy is not in sight&mdash;and yet,
from somewhere unseen, death-dealing musketry frustrates
every assault.
</p>

<p>
'Return to the charge!' is the Duke of Parma's curt
command, and sends one of his ablest officers to lead a
fresh charge.  He himself organizes a diversion, crosses the
small rivulet, which flows into the Schelde at the foot of
Cantimpré, and trains his artillery upon a vulnerable piece
of wall, between the bastion and the river bank.  He has
the finest culverines known in Europe at this time, made
on a new pattern lately invented in England; his cannon
balls are the most powerful ever used in warfare, and some
of his musketeers know how to discharge ten shots in a
quarter of an hour&mdash;an accomplishment never excelled even
by the French.
</p>

<p>
So, while one of his ablest officers is in charge of the
attacking party on the breach, His Highness himself directs
a new set of operations.  Once more the roar of artillery
and of musketry rend the air with their portentous sound.
The Duke of Parma's picked men attack the last bastion
of Cantimpré, whilst from the roads of Arras, of Sailly and
Bapaume, the whole of the Spanish infantry rush like a
mighty wave to the charge.
</p>

<p>
Pikemen and halberdiers, archers and lancers, once more
to the assault!  Are ye indeed cowards, that a pack of
Flemish rabble can hold you at bay till you sink back
exhausted and beaten?  Up, Bracamonte and Ribeiras!
Messar, with your musketeers!  Salvado, with your
bow-men!  Up, ye mighty Spanish armies, who have seen the
world at your feet!  With Farnese himself to lead you,
the hero of an hundred sieges, the queller of an hundred
rebellions; are ye dolts and fools that you cannot crush
a handful of undisciplined rabble?
</p>

<p>
And in close masses, shoulder to shoulder, they
come!&mdash;exhausted, but still obstinate, and with the hope of all
the rich booty to lure them on.  Down the declivity of the
moat&mdash;no longer deep, now that it is filled with dead!
And up again to below the walls!  The setting sun is behind
them and gleams on their breastplates and their bonnets,
and gilds the edges of the battlements with lines of flame.
</p>

<p>
And, up on the crumbling battlements, the defenders
of Cambray&mdash;the clerks and shopkeepers and churls&mdash;hear
the tramp of many feet, feel the earth quivering beneath
this thunder of a last mighty assault.  Sturdy, undaunted
hands grip lance and pike tighter still, and intrepid hearts
wait for this final charge, as they have waited for others
to-day, and will go on waiting till the last of them has
stilled its beating.
</p>

<p>
And Gilles de Crohin in their midst, invincible and cool,
scours the battlements and the breach, the bastions and the
ramparts&mdash;always there where he is needed most, where
spirits want reviving or courage needs the impetus of praise.
He knows as well as they do that gunpowder is running
short, that arrows are few and thousands of weapons broken
with usage: he knows, better than they do, that if de
Balagny's troop tarries much longer all this heroic resistance
will have been in vain.
</p>

<p>
So he keeps his own indomitable little army on the
leash, husbanding precious lives and no less precious
ammunition; keeping them back, well away from the parapets,
lest the sight of the enemy down below lead them on to
squander both.  Thus, of all that goes on beneath the walls,
of the nature of the attack or the chances of a surprise,
the stout defenders can see nothing.  Only Gilles, whilst
scouring the lines, can see; for he has crawled on his hands
and knees to the outermost edge of the crumbling parapet
and has gazed down upon the Duke of Parma's hordes.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
Now the Spanish halbertmen have reached the hither
side of the moat.  The breach is before them, tantalizingly
open.  The lancers are following over the improvised bridges,
and behind them the musketeers are sending a volley of
shot over their heads into the breach.  It is all done with
much noise and clash of steel and thundering artillery and
cries of 'Long live King Philip!'&mdash;all to cover the disposing
of scaling ladders against the walls.
</p>

<p>
The pikemen are executing this surprise attack, one
in which they are adepts.  The noisy onslaught, the roar
of artillery, the throwing of dust in the eyes of wearied
defenders; then the silent scaling of the walls, the rush
upon the battlements, wholesale panic and slaughter.
</p>

<p>
Alexander Farnese hath oft employed these devices and
hath never known them to fail.  So the men throw down
their pikes, carry pistols in their right hand and a short
dagger-like sword between their teeth.  They fix their
ladders&mdash;five of them&mdash;and begin quite noiselessly to mount.
Ten on each ladder, which makes fifty all told, and they
the flower of the Duke of Parma's troops.  Up they swarm
like human ants striving to reach a hillock.  Now the
gunners have to cease firing, lest they hit those ladders
with their human freight.
</p>

<p>
And while at the breach the men of Cambray make their
last desperate stand, the first of the Spanish pikemen has
reached the topmost rung of his ladder.  The human ants
have come to the top of their hillock.  Already the foremost
amongst them has begun to hoist himself up, with his
hands clinging to the uneven masonry.  The next second
or two would have seen him with his leg over the parapet,
and already a cry of triumph has risen to his lips, when
suddenly, before his horror-stricken gaze, a man surges up,
as if out of the ground, stands there before him for one
second, which is as tense as it is terrifying.  Then, with a
mighty blow from some heavy weapon which he holds, he
fells the pikeman down.  The man loses his footing, gives
a loud cry of horror and falls headlong some forty feet.
In his fall he drags two or three of his comrades with him.
But the ladder still stands, and on it the human ants,
reinforced at once by others, resume their climb.  Only for a
minute&mdash;no more!  The next, a pair of hands with titanic
strength and a grip of iron seizes the ladder by the shafts,
holds it for one brief, agonizing moment, and then hurls
it down with the whole of its human freight into the depth
below.
</p>

<p>
An awful cry rends the air, but is quickly drowned by
the roar of cannon and musketry.  It has been a mere
incident.  The Duke has not done more than mutter an
oath in his beard.  He is watching the four other ladders
on which his human ants are climbing.  But the oath dies
on his lips&mdash;even he becomes silent in face of the appalling
catastrophe which he sees.  That man up there whom already
he has learned to fear, that man in the tattered doublet
and the ragged hose&mdash;he it is who has turned the tables
on Farnese's best <i>ruse de guerre</i>.  With lightning rapidity
and wellnigh superhuman strength, he repeats his feat once
more.  Once more a scaling ladder bearing its precious
human freight is hurled down into the depth.  The man
now appears like a Titan.  Ye gods! or ye devils! which
of you gave him that strength?  Now he has reached the
third ladder.  Just perhaps one second too late, for the
leading pikeman has already gained a foothold upon the
battlements, stands there on guard to shield the ladder;
for he has scented the danger which threatens him and his
comrades.  His pistol is raised even as Gilles approaches.
The Duke of Parma feels as if his heart had stilled its
beating.  Another second, and that daring rebel would be laid
low.
</p>

<p>
But Gilles too has seen the danger&mdash;the danger to himself
and to the city which he is defending.  No longer has he
the time to seize the ladder as he has done before, no longer
the chance of exerting that titanic strength which God hath
lent him so that he might save Cambray.  One second&mdash;it
is the most precious one this threatened city hath yet known,
for in it Fate is holding the balance, and the life of her
defender is at stake.  One second!
</p>

<p>
The Spanish pikemen are swarming up dangerously near
now to the battlements.  The next instant Gilles has picked
up a huge piece of masonry from the ground, holds it for
one moment with both hands above his head, then hurls
it with all his might against the ladder.  The foremost
man is the first to fall.  His pistol goes off in his hand with
a loud report.  Immediately below him the weight of the
falling stone has made matchwood of the ladder and the
men are hurled to their death, almost without uttering a
groan.  The Flemish halbertmen in the meanwhile have
rushed up to the battlements; seeing Gilles' manoeuvre,
they are eager to emulate it.  There are two more ladders
propped against the falling walls and their leader's strength
must in truth be spent.  And there are still more Spaniards
to come, more of those numberless hordes, before whom a
handful of untrained burghers are making their last and
desperate stand.
</p>

<p>
Just then Gilles has paused in order to gaze once more
into the far-away west.  Already the gold of the sun has
turned to rose and crimson, already the low-lying horizon
appears aflame with the setting glow.  But now upon the
distant horizon line something appears to move, something
more swift and sudden and vivid than the swaying willows
by the river bank or the tall poplars nodding to the evening
breeze.  Flames of fire dart and flash, a myriad specks of
dust gleam like lurid smoke and the earth shakes with the
tramp of many horses' hoofs.  Far away on the Bapaume
road the forerunners of de Balagny's troops are seen
silhouetted against the glowing sky.
</p>

<p>
Gilles has seen them.  Aid has come at last.  One more
stupendous effort, one more superhuman exertion of will,
and the day is won.  He calls aloud to the depleted garrison,
to that handful of men who, brave and undaunted, stand
around him still.
</p>

<p>
'At them, burghers of Cambray!  France comes to your
aid!  See her mighty army thundering down the road!
Down with the Spaniard!  This is the hour of your
victory!'
</p>

<p>
As many times before, his resonant voice puts heart into
them once again.  Once again they grip halberds and lances
with the determination born of hope.  They rush to the
battlements and with mighty hands hurl the Spanish scaling
ladders from their walls, pick up bits of stone, fragments of
granite and of iron, use these as missiles upon the heads
of the attacking party below.  The archers on one knee shoot
with deadly precision.  They have been given half a dozen
arrows each&mdash;the last&mdash;and every one of them finds its
mark.
</p>

<p>
Surprised and confounded by this recrudescence of energy,
the Spaniards pause.  An hundred of them lie dead or
dying at the foot of the wall.  Their ranks are broken;
don Miguel tries to rally them.  But he is hit by an arrow
in the throat, ere he succeeds.  De Landas is close by, runs
to the rescue, tries to re-form the ranks, and sees Gilles de
Crohin standing firm upon the battlements and hears his
triumphant, encouraging cry:
</p>

<p>
'Citizens of Cambray, France has come to your aid!'
</p>

<p>
Confusion begins to wave her death-dealing wand.  The
halbertmen at the breach stand for full five minutes almost
motionless under a hail of arrows and missiles, waiting for
the word of command.
</p>

<p>
And on the Bapaume road, de Balagny and his troops
are quickly drawing nigh.  Already the white banner with
the gold Fleur-de-Lys stands out clearly against the sky.
</p>

<p>
Parma has seen it, and cursed with savage fury.  He is
a great and mighty warrior and knows that the end has
come.  The day has brought failure and disgrace; duty
now lies in saving a shred of honour and the remnants of
a scattered army.  He cannot understand how it has all
happened, whence this French troop has come and by whose
orders.  He is superstitious and mystical and fears to
see in this the vengeful finger of God.  So he crosses himself
and mutters a quick prayer, even as a volley of musketry
fired insolently into the air, reverberates down the Bapaume
road.
</p>

<p>
France is here with her great armies, her unconquered
generals: Condé, Turenne, have come to the rescue.
Parma's wearied troops cannot possibly stand the strain of
fighting in the rear whilst still pushing home the attack in
front.  How numerous is the French advancing troop it
is impossible to guess.  They come with mighty clatter
and many useless volleys of musketry, with jingling of harness
and breastplates and clatter of hoofs upon the road.  They
come with a mighty shout of 'Valois! and Fleur-de-Lys!'  They
wave their banners and strike their lances and pikes
together.  They come!  They come!
</p>

<p>
And the half-exhausted Spanish army hears and sees
them too.  The halbertmen pause and listen, the archers
halt halfway across the moat, whilst all around the whisper
goes from mouth to mouth:
</p>

<p>
"The French are on us!  Sauve qui peut!"
</p>

<p>
Panic seizes the men.  They turn and scurry back over
the declivity of the moat.  The stampede has commenced:
first the cavalry, then the infantrymen, for the French are
in the rear and legions of unseen spirits have come to the
aid of Cambray.
</p>

<p>
The Duke of Parma now looks like a broken wreck of his
former arrogant self.  His fine accoutrements are torn,
the trappings of his charger are in tatters, his beard has
been singed with gunpowder, he has no hat, no cloak.  Raging
fury is in his husky voice as he shouts orders and counter-orders
to men who no longer hear.  He calls to his officers,
alternately adjures and insults them.  But the French
troops draw nearer and nearer, and nothing but Death will
stop those running Spanish soldiers now.
</p>

<p>
To right and left of the Bapaume road they run, leaving
that road free for the passage of de Balagny's small troop.
Out in the western sky, the sun is setting in a mantle of
vivid crimson, which is like the colour of human blood.  The
last glow illumines the final disgrace of Parma's hitherto
unconquered hordes.  The cavalry is galloping back to the
distant camp, with broken reins and stirrups hanging
loose, steel bonnets awry, swords, lances, broken or wilfully
thrown aside.  Behind them, the infantry, the archers,
the pikemen, the halberdiers&mdash;all running and dragging
their officers away with them in their flight.
</p>

<p>
Parma's unconquered army has ceased to be.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VI
</h4>

<p>
Then it is that Gilles de Crohin stands once again on the
very edge of the broken parapet and fronts the valiant
men of Cambray, who have known how to conquer and
how to die.  The setting sun draws lines of glowing crimson
round his massive figure.  His clothes are now mere tattered
rags; he is bleeding from several wounds; his face is
almost unrecognizable, coal-black with grime and powder;
but his eyes still sparkle with pride of victory.
</p>

<p>
'Citizens of Cambray, you are free!' he cries.  'Long
live France!  Long live the Flower o' the Lily!'
</p>

<p>
And down in the plain below, where the remnants of a
disintegrated army are being slowly swallowed up by the
gathering dusk, the Duke of Parma has paused for one
moment before starting on his own headlong flight.  He
sees the man who has beaten his mighty armies, the man
whose valour and indomitable will has inflicted untarnishable
humiliation upon the glory of Spain.  With a loud
curse, he cries:
</p>

<p>
'Will no one rid me of that insolent rebel?'
</p>

<p>
De Landas is near him just then.  He too had paused
to look once again on the city which had been his home
and which he had so basely betrayed, and once again on
the man whom he hated with an intensity of passion which
this day of glory and infamy had for ever rendered futile.
</p>

<p>
'If I do,' he retorts exultantly, 'what will your Highness
give me?'
</p>

<p>
'Cambray and all it contains,' replies the Duke fiercely.
</p>

<p>
De Landas gives a cry of prescient triumph.  A lancer
is galloping by.  The young man, with a swift, powerful
gesture, seizes the horse by the bridle, forces it back on its
haunches till it rears and throws its rider down into the
mud.  De Landas swings himself into the saddle, rides
back to within a hundred paces of the city walls.  Here
confusion is still holding sway; belated runaways are
darting aimlessly hither and thither like helpless sheep; the
wounded and the maimed are making pitiable efforts to
find a corner wherein to hide.  The ground is littered with
the dead and the dying, with abandoned cannon and spent
arrows, with pikes and halberts and broken swords and
lances.
</p>

<p>
De Landas halts, jumps down from his horse, looks about
him for a crossbow and a quiver, and finds what he wants.
Then he selects his position carefully, well under cover and
just near enough to get a straight hit at the man whom he
hates more than anything else in the world.  Opportunity
seems to favour him.  Gilles is standing well forward on the
broken parapet, his throat and chest are bare, his broad
figure stands out clear-cut against the distant sky.  He is
gazing out towards the west, straight in the direction where
de Landas is cowering&mdash;a small, unperceived unit in the
inextricable confusion which reigns around.
</p>

<p>
He has found the place which best suits his purpose,
has placed his stock in position and adjusted his arrow.
Being a Spanish gentleman, he is well versed in the use of
every weapon necessary for war.  He takes careful aim, for
he is in no hurry and is determined not to miss.
</p>

<p>
'Cambray and all it contains!' the Duke of Parma has
promised him if he succeeds in his purpose.
</p>

<p>
One second, and the deed is done.  The arrow has whizzed
through the air.  The next instant, Gilles de Crohin has
thrown up his arms.
</p>

<p>
'Citizens of Cambray, wait for France!' he cries, and
before any of his friends can get to him, he has given one
turn and then fallen backwards into the depth below.
</p>

<p>
De Landas has already thrown down his crossbow,
recaptured his horse and galloped back at break-neck speed
in the wake of the flying army.
</p>

<p>
And even then the joy-bells of Cambray begin to ring
their merry peal.  Balagny's troops have entered the city
through the open breach in her walls, whilst down there
in the moat, on a pile of dying and dead, her defender and
saviour lies with a murderous arrow in his breast.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VII
</h4>

<p>
De Landas rides like one possessed away from the scene
of his dastardly deed; nor does he draw rein till he has
come up once more with the Duke of Parma.
</p>

<p>
'At any rate, we are rid of him,' he says curtly.  'And
next time we attack, it will only be with an undisciplined
mob that we shall have to deal.'
</p>

<p>
All around him the mighty army of Parma is melting
like snow under the first kiss of a warm sun.  Every man
who hath limbs left wherewith to run, flies panic-stricken
down the roads, across fields and rivulets and morasses,
throwing down arms, overturning everything that comes
in his way, not heeding the cries of the helpless and trampling
on the dead.
</p>

<p>
Less than an hour has gone by since France's battle-cry
first resounded on the Bapaume road, and now there is
not one Spanish soldier left around the walls of Cambray,
save the wounded and the slain.  These lie about scattered
everywhere, like pawns upon an abandoned chess-board.
The moat below the breach is full of them.  Maître Jehan
le Bègue has not far to seek for the master and comrade
whom he loves so dearly.  He has seen him fall from the
parapet, struck by the cowardly hand of an assassin in the
very hour of victory.  So, whilst de Balagny's chief captains
enter Cambray in triumph, Jehan seeks in the moat for the
friend whom he has lost.
</p>

<p>
He finds him lying there with de Landas' arrow still
sticking in the wound in his breast.  Maître Jehan lifts
him as tenderly as a mother would lift her sick child, hoists
him across his broad shoulders, and then slowly wends his
way along the road back to La Fère.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br /><br />
HOW CAMBRAY STARVED AND ENDURED
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
As for the rest, 'tis in the domain of history.  Not only
Maître Manuchet, but Le Carpentier in his splendid
<i>History of Cambray</i>, has told us how the Duke of Parma's
armies, demoralized by that day of disasters, took as many
weeks to recuperate and to rally as did the valiant city to
recover from her wounds.
</p>

<p>
Too late did Parma discover that he had been hoaxed,
that the massed French troops, who had terrified his armies,
consisted of a handful of men, who had been made to shout
and to make much noise, so as to scare those whom they
could not have hoped to conquer in open fight.  It was too
late now for the great general to retrieve his blunder; but
not too late to prepare a fresh line of action, wait for
reinforcements, reorganize the forces at his command and then
to resume the siege of Cambray, with the added hope of
inflicting material punishment upon the rebel city for the
humiliation which she had caused him to endure.
</p>

<p>
The French armies were still very far away.  Parma's
numerous spies soon brought him news that Monsieur
Duc d'Anjou, was only now busy in collecting and training
a force which eventually might hope to vie in strength
and equipment with the invincible Spanish troops, whilst
the King of France would apparently have nothing to do
with the affair and openly disapproved of his brother's
intervention in the business of the Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
The moment therefore was all in favour of the Spanish
commander; but even so he did not again try to take
Cambray by storm.  Many historians have averred that a
nameless superstition was holding him back, that he had seen
in the almost supernatural resistance of the city, the warning
finger of God.  Be that as it may, he became, after the day
of disaster, content to invest the approaches to the French
frontier, and after awhile, when his reinforcements had
arrived, he formed with his armies a girdle around Cambray
with a view to reducing her by starvation.
</p>

<p>
A less glorious victory mayhap, but a more assured one!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
So Cambray starved and endured.
</p>

<p>
For four months her citizens waited, confident that the
promised help from France would come in the end.  They
had hoped and trusted on that never-to-be-forgotten day
four months ago when they covered themselves with glory,
and their trust had not been misplaced.  The masked
stranger whom they had followed unto death and victory,
the man who had rallied them and cheered them, who had
shown them the example of intrepid valour and heroic
self-sacrifice, had promised them help from France on that day,
and that help had come just as he had promised.  Now
that he was gone from them, the burghers and the soldiers,
the poor and the rich alike&mdash;aye! even the women and the
children&mdash;would have felt themselves eternally disgraced
if they had surrendered their city which he had so
magnificently defended.
</p>

<p>
So they tightened their belts and starved, and waited
with stoicism and patience for the hour of their deliverance.
</p>

<p>
And every evening when the setting sun threw a shaft
of crimson light through the stately windows of Notre
Dame, and the gathering dusk drew long shadows around
the walls, the people of Cambray would meet on the Place
d'Armes inside the citadel, and pray for the return of the
hero who had fought for their liberty.  Men and women
with pale, gaunt faces, on which hunger and privations
had already drawn indelible lines; men and women, some
of whom had perhaps never before turned their thoughts
to anything but material cares and material pleasures,
flocked now to pray beneath the blue vault of heaven and
to think of the man who had saved them from ruin and
disgrace.
</p>

<p>
Nobody believed that he was dead; though many had
seen him fall, they felt that he would return.  God Himself
had given Cambray her defender in the hour of her greatest
peril: God had not merely given in order to take away
again.  Vague rumours were afloat that the mysterious hero
was none other than the Duc d'Anjou, own brother of the
King of France, who one day would be Sovereign Lord over
all the United Provinces; but as to that, no one cared.
He who was gone was the Defender of Cambray: as such,
he was enshrined in thousands of hearts, as such he would
return one day to receive the gratitude and the love of the
people who worshipped him.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Le Carpentier draws a kindly veil over the sufferings of
the unfortunate city.  With pathetic exactitude, he tells
us that a cow during the siege fetched as much as three
hundred francs&mdash;an enormous sum these days&mdash;a sheep
fifty francs, an egg forty sols and an ounce of salt eight
sols; but he altogether omits to tell us what happened
to the poor people, who had neither fifty francs nor yet
forty sols to spend.
</p>

<p>
Maître Manuchet, on the other hand, assures us that at
one time bread was entirely unobtainable and that rats
and mice formed a part of the daily menu of the rich.  He
is more crude in his statements than Le Carpentier, and
even lifts for our discreet gaze just one corner of that veil,
wherewith history has chosen to conceal for ever the anguish
of a suffering city.  He shows us three distinct pictures,
only sketched in in mere outline, but with boldness and an
obvious regard for truth.
</p>

<p>
One of these pictures is of Jacqueline de Broyart, the
wealthy heiress who shared with the departed hero the
worship of the citizens of Cambray.  Manuchet speaks of
her as of an angel of charity, healing and soothing with words
and hands and heart, as of a vision of paradise in the midst
of a torturing hell&mdash;her courage and endurance a prop for
drooping spirits; her voice a sweet, insistent sound above
the cries of pain, the curses and the groans.  Wide-eyed
and pale, but with a cheering smile upon her lips, she flits
through the deserted streets of Cambray, bringing the solace
of her presence, the help that can be given, the food that
can be shared, to many a suffering home.
</p>

<p>
Of the man who hath possession of her heart, she never
speaks with those in authority; but when in a humble
home there is talk of the hero who has gone and of his
probable return, she listens in silence, and when conjectures
fly around her as to his identity, she even tries to smile.
But in her heart she knows that her knight&mdash;the man whom
the people worship&mdash;will never come back.  France will
send troops and aid and protection anon; a puissant Prince
will enter Cambray mayhap at the head of his troops and
be acclaimed as the saviour of Cambray.  She would no
doubt in the fullness of time plight her troth to that man,
and the people would be told that this was indeed the Duc
d'Anjou et d'Alençon, who had once before stood upon the
ramparts of Cambray and shouted his defiant cry: 'À
moi, citizens; and let the body of each one of you here be
a living rampart for the defence of your homes!'
</p>

<p>
But she would know that the man who spoke those inspiring
words had gone from her for ever.  Who he was, where
he came from, what had brought him to Cambray under a
disguise and an assumed name, she would perhaps never
know.  Nor did she care.  He was the man she loved: the
man whose passionate ardour had thrilled her to the soul,
whose touch had been as magic, whose voice had been
perfect music set in perfect time.  He was the man she
loved&mdash;her knight.  Throughout that day upon the ramparts
she had seen him undaunted, intrepid, unconquered&mdash;rallying
those who quaked, cheering those who needed
help, regardless of danger, devoted even unto death.  So
what cared she what was his name?  Whoever he was, he
was worthy of her love.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
The second picture which the historian shows us is more
dispiriting and more grim.  It is a picture of Cambray in
the last days of July.  The Spanish armies have invested
the city completely for over eight weeks, and Cambray has
been thrown entirely on her own resources and the activities
of a few bold spirits for the barest necessities of life.
Starvation&mdash;grim and unrelenting&mdash;is taking her toll of the
exhausted population; disease begins to haunt the abodes
of squalor and of misery.
</p>

<p>
France has promised aid and France still tarries.
</p>

<p>
Mayhap France has forgotten long ago.
</p>

<p>
In Cambray now a vast silence reigns&mdash;the silence of
impending doom.  The streets are deserted during the day,
the church bells are silent.  Only at evening, in the gloom,
weird and melancholy sounds fill the air, groans and husky
voices, and at times the wild shriek of some demented brain.
</p>

<p>
Cambray has fought for her liberty; now she is enduring
for it&mdash;and enduring it with a fortitude and determination,
which is one Of the most glorious entries in the book of the
recording angel.  Every morning at dawn the heralds of
the Spanish commander mount the redoubt on the Bapaume
road, and with a loud flourish of brass trumpets they demand
in the name of His Majesty the King of Spain the surrender
of the rebel city.  And every day the summons is answered
by a grim and defiant silence.  After which, Cambray settles
down to another day of suffering.
</p>

<p>
The city fathers have worked wonders in organization.
From the first, the distribution of accumulated provisions
has been systematic and rigidly fair.  But those distributions,
from being scanty have become wholly insufficient,
and lives that before flickered feebly, have gone out
altogether, while others continue a mere struggle for existence,
which would be degrading were its object not so sublime.
</p>

<p>
Cambray will not surrender!  She would sooner starve
and rot and be consumed by fire, but with her integrity
whole, her courage undoubted, the honour of her women
unsullied.  Disease may haunt her streets, famine knock
at every door; but at least while her citizens have one
spark of life left in their bodies, while their emaciated hands
have a vestige of power wherewith to grasp a musket, no
Spanish soldier shall defile her pavements, no Spanish
commander work his tyrannical will with her.
</p>

<p>
Cambray will not surrender!  She believes in her defender
and her saviour!&mdash;in his words that France will presently
come with invincible might and powerful armies, when
all her sufferings will be turned to relief and to joy.  And
every evening when lights are put out and darkness settles
down upon the stricken city, wrapping under her beneficent
mantle all the misery, the terrors and the heroism, men
and women lay themselves down to their broken rest with
a last murmur of hope, a last invocation to God for the
return of the hero in whom lies their trust.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
And in the Town Hall the city fathers sit in Council,
with Messire de Balagny there, and Monseigneur d'Inchy
presiding.  They, too, appear grimly resolved to endure
and to hold out; the fire of patriotism and of enthusiasm
burns in their hearts, as it does in the heart of every burgher,
noble or churl in the city.  But, side by side with enthusiasm,
stalks the grim shadow of prescience&mdash;knowledge of the
resources which go, diminishing bit by bit, until the inevitable
hour when hands and mouths will still be stretched out
for food and there will be nothing left to give.
</p>

<p>
Even now, it is less than bare subsistence which can be
doled out day by day; and in more than one face assembled
this day around the Council Board, there is limned the grim
line of nascent despair.
</p>

<p>
It is only d'Inchy who has not lost one particle of his
faith, one particle of self-confidence and of belief in ultimate
triumph.
</p>

<p>
'If ye begin to doubt,' he exclaims with tragic directness,
'how will ye infuse trust in the hearts of your people?'
</p>

<p>
The Chief Magistrate shakes his head; the Provosts
are silent.  More than one man wipes a surreptitious tear.
</p>

<p>
'We must give the people something to hearten them,'
has been the persistent call from those in authority.
</p>

<p>
De Balagny interposes:
</p>

<p>
'Our spies have succeeded in evading the Spanish lines
more than once.  One of them returned yesterday from La
Fère.  He says the Duc d'Anjou is wellnigh ready.  The
next month should see the end of our miseries.'
</p>

<p>
'A month!' sighs the Chief Magistrate.  'The people
cannot hold out another month.  They are on the verge of
despair.'
</p>

<p>
'They begin to murmur,' adds one of the Provosts glumly.
</p>

<p>
'And some demand that we surrender the city,' concludes
de Lalain.
</p>

<p>
'Surrender the city!' exclaimed d'Inchy vehemently.  'Never!'
</p>

<p>
'Then can Monseigneur suggest something?' riposts
the Chief Magistrate dryly, 'that will restore confidence to
a starving population?'
</p>

<p>
'The help from France almost within sight,' urges
Monseigneur.
</p>

<p>
The Provosts shrug their shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'So long delayed,' one of them says.  'The people have
ceased to believe in it.'
</p>

<p>
'Many declare the Duke is dead,' urges another.
</p>

<p>
'But ye know better than that, Messires,' retorts d'Inchy
sternly.
</p>

<p>
Again one or two of the older men shrug their shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'I saw him fall from the ramparts,' asserts one.
</p>

<p>
'He was struck full in the breast by an arrow,' says
another, 'shot by an unseen hand&mdash;some abominable
assassin.  His Highness gave one turn and fell into the
moat below.'
</p>

<p>
'And was immediately found and picked up by some of
my men,' retorts de Balagny hotly.  'Mine oath on it!
Our spies have seen him&mdash;spoken with him.  The Duc
d'Anjou is alive and on his way to Cambray.  I'd stake on
it the salvation of my soul!'
</p>

<p>
The others sigh, some of them dubiously, others with
renewed hope.  From their talk we gather that not one
of them has any doubt in his mind as to the identity of the
brave defender of Cambray.  Nothing had in truth happened
to shake their faith in him, and de Balagny had said nothing
to shake that faith.  On that fateful day in April they had
been convened to witness the betrothal of Madame Jacqueline
de Broyart to <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou, had been presented
to His Highness and kissed his hands.  Then suddenly
all had been confusion&mdash;the panic, the surprise attack, the
runaway soldiers, and finally the one man who rallied every
quaking spirit and defended the city with heart and mind,
with counsel and strength of arm, until he fell by an unseen
assassin's hand: he, the Duc d'Anjou, of the princely House
of France&mdash;the future Sovereign Lord of a United Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
For awhile there is absolute stillness in the Council room.
No one speaks; hardly does any one stir.  Only the massive
clock over the monumental hearth ticks out every succeeding
second with relentless monotony.  Monseigneur is
buried in thought.  The others wait, respectfully silent.
Then suddenly d'Inchy looks up and gazes determinedly
on the faces round him.
</p>

<p>
'Madame Jacqueline must help us,' he says firmly.
</p>

<p>
'Madame Jacqueline?' the Chief Magistrate exclaims.  'How?'
</p>

<p>
'On the Place d'Armes&mdash;one evening&mdash;during the intercession,'
Monseigneur goes on, speaking rapidly and with
unhesitating resolve.  'She will make a solemn declaration
before the assembled people&mdash;plight her troth to the Duc
d'Anjou, who, though still absent, has sent her a token of
his immediate arrival.'
</p>

<p>
'Sent her a token?' most of them murmur, astonished.
And even de Balagny frowns in puzzlement.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' rejoins d'Inchy impatiently.  'Cannot you see?
You say the people no longer believe in the coming of His
Highness.  Our spies and the news they bring no longer
carry weight.  But if we say that the Duke hath sent a
token....'
</p>

<p>
'I understand,' murmurs the Chief Magistrate, and the
others nod in comprehension.
</p>

<p>
'Madame Jacqueline will not demur,' d'Inchy continues
insistently.  'She will accept the assurance from me that
one of our spies has come in contact with <i>Monsieur</i> and
brought back a fresh token of his promise to her ... a
ring, for instance.  We have many valuable ones in our
city treasury.  One of them will serve our purpose.'  Then,
as the city dignitaries are still silent, somewhat perturbed
at all that sophistry&mdash;''Tis for the sake of our city, Messires,'
d'Inchy urges with a note of pleading in his usually
commanding voice.  'A little deception, when so much good
may come of it! what is it?  Surely you can reconcile it
with your consciences!'
</p>

<p>
To him the matter seems trivial.  One deception more
or less&mdash;hitherto the path had been so easy.  He frowns,
seeing that this tiresome pack of old men hesitate, when
to acquiesce might even now save their city.  Anyhow, he
is the governor.  His word is law.  For the nonce he chooses
to argue and to persuade, but anon he commands.
</p>

<p>
The city dignitaries&mdash;the old men for the most part, and
with impaired health after weeks of privation&mdash;have but
little real resistance in them.  D'Inchy was always a man
of arbitrary will and persuasive eloquence.  De Balagny is
soon won over.  He ranges himself on the side of the
governor, and helps in the work of demolishing the bulwark
of the Magistrate's opposition.  The latter yields&mdash;reluctantly,
perhaps&mdash;but still he yields.  After all, there
is no harm whatever in the deception.  No one could
possibly suffer in consequence.  Madame Jacqueline has always
expressed herself ready to marry the Duc d'Anjou&mdash;a
hero and a doughty knight, if ever there was one!&mdash;and in
any case it were an inestimable boon to put fresh heart
into the starving population.
</p>

<p>
So gradually the others yield, and Monseigneur is satisfied.
He elaborates his plan, his mind full of details to
make the result more sure.  A public ceremony: Jacqueline
once more publicly betrothed to the Duc d'Anjou&mdash;dedicated,
in fact, like a worshipper to some patron saint.
Then the people made to realize that the Duc d'Anjou
is already known to them as their hero, their defender and
their saviour; that he is not dead, but coming back to
them very soon at the head of his armies this time, to save
them once for all from the Spaniards, whilst he remains
with them to the end of his days as their chosen Sovereign
Lord and King.
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur has worked himself up to a high pitch of
enthusiasm, carries the others with him now, until they
cast aside all foreboding and gloom and hope springs afresh
in their hearts.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VI
</h4>

<p>
Thus we see the third and last picture which Enguerrand
de Manuchet shows us of Cambray in her agony.  It is a
picture that is even more vivid than the others, more alive
in the intensity of its pathos.  We see inside the citadel
on the last day of July, 1581.  And of all the episodes
connected with the memorable siege of Cambray and with its
heroic defence, not one perhaps is more moving than that
of this huge concourse of people&mdash;men, women and tiny
children&mdash;assembled here and for such a purpose, under
the blue dome of the sky.
</p>

<p>
The grim walls of the ancient castle around them are
hung with worn and tattered flags; they are like the interior
of a church, decked out with all the solemnity of a marriage
ceremony and all the pathos of a De Profundis.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline, indifferent to everything save to the welfare
of the city, has accepted without resistance or doubt
Monseigneur's story of the spy, the Duc d'Anjou and the token.
The ring, borrowed for the occasion from the city treasury,
she has taken without any misgiving, as coming straight
from the man whom she is destined to marry.  She had
promised long ago to wed <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou, because
the weal of her country was, it seems, wrapped up in that
union.  All those who worked for the glorious future of
Flanders had assured her that much of it depended in her
acquiescence to this alliance with France.
</p>

<p>
With her heart for ever buried beneath the ramparts
of Cambray, side by side with the gallant knight who had
given his life for the beloved city, she cared little, if at all,
what became of her.  The Duc d'Anjou or another&mdash;what
did it matter?&mdash;but preferably the Duc d'Anjou if her
country's welfare demands that he should be the man.
</p>

<p>
No wonder that this last picture stirs even the heart of
the dry-as-dust old historian to enthusiasm.  Noble and
churl, burghers and dignitaries and soldiers, toilers and
ragamuffins, all are there&mdash;those who can walk or stand or
crawl.  Those who are hale drag or support those that are
sick, bring tattered mattresses along or a litter of straw for
them to lie on.  But they all come to see a woman make
a solemn profession of faith in the man who is to bring
deliverance to the agonizing city.
</p>

<p>
They come in their thousands; but thousands more are
unable to find room upon the Place or within the Citadel.
Even so, they line the streets all the way to the Archiepiscopal
Palace, whilst all those who are so privileged watch
Madame Jacqueline's progress through the streets from their
windows or their balconies.  Fortunately the day has been
brilliantly fine ever since morning, and the sun shines radiant
upon this one day which is almost a happy one.
</p>

<p>
For many hours before that fixed for the ceremony, the
streets seethe with the crowd&mdash;a pathetic crowd, in truth:
gaunt, feeble, weary, in tattered clothes, some scarce able
to drag themselves along, others sick and emaciated, clinging
to the posts at the corners of the streets, just to get
one peep at what has come to be regarded as a tangible
ray of hope.  A silent, moveless crowd, whose husky voice
has scarce a cheer in it; as Jacqueline passes by, walking
between Monseigneur the governor and the Chief Magistrate,
bare arms are waved here and there, in a feeble attempt
at jubilation.  But there is no music, no beating of drums
or waving of banners; there is no alms-giving, no largesse!
All that the rich and the prosperous possessed in the past
has been shared and distributed long ago.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the brilliant weather, the scene is dark and
dreary.  The weary, begrimed faces do not respond to the
joyous kiss of the sun; the smile of hope has not the power
to dry every tear.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VII
</h4>

<p>
And now Jacqueline stands, like a white Madonna lily,
in the centre of the Place d'Armes.  Monseigneur the
governor is beside her and around her are grouped the high
dignitaries of the city, standing or sitting upon low
velvet-covered stools.  The Chief Magistrate and Messire de
Balagny are in the forefront, and behind them are the
members of the States General and of the Town, the Provosts
and Captains of the City Guard.  The picture is sombre
still, despite the banners of the guilds and the flags of various
provinces which hang along the walls of the Citadel.  The
russets and browns, the blacks and dull reds, absorb the
evening light without throwing back any golden reflections.
The shadows are long and dense.
</p>

<p>
The white satin of Jacqueline's gown is the one bright
note of colour against the dull and drab background; its
stiff folds gleam with honey-coloured lights in the slowly
sinking sun.  She has allowed old Nicolle to deck her out
in all her finery, the gown which she wore on that
night&mdash;oh! so very long ago&mdash;at the banquet, the one with the
pale green underdress which Messire declared made her
look so like a lily; the pearls in her hair; the velvet
shoes on her feet.
</p>

<p>
'I will plight my troth publicly to the Defender of
Cambray!' she had said to her guardian, when Monseigneur
had first spoken of the proposed ceremony.
</p>

<p>
'To Monsieur Duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon, my child,'
Monseigneur had insisted, and frowned slightly at what he
called his ward's romantic fancies.
</p>

<p>
''Tis to the Defender of Cambray that I will dedicate
my faith,' she had continued obstinately.
</p>

<p>
'Let the child be!' de Lalain had interposed, seeing
that d'Inchy was about to lose his temper.  'After all,
what does it matter, seeing that the Defender of Cambray
and Monsieur Duc d'Anjou are one and the same?'
</p>

<p>
D'Inchy gave in.  It did not really matter.  If Jacqueline
still harboured a doubt as to the identity of the masked
stranger, it would soon be dispelled when Monsieur entered
Cambray and came to claim her openly.  Women were apt
to have strange fancies; and this one, on Jacqueline's part,
was harmless enough.
</p>

<p>
In any case, she appeared satisfied, and henceforth was
quite submissive.  In the midst of her sorrow, she felt a
sweet, sad consolation in the thought that she would
publicly plight her troth to the man whom she loved, proclaim
before the whole world&mdash;her world that is, the only one
that mattered&mdash;that she was for ever affianced to the brave
man who had given his life, that Cambray might be saved.
</p>

<p>
In an inward vision she could see him still, as she saw
him on that day upon the ramparts, with the April sun
gilding his close-cropped head, with the light of enthusiasm
dancing in his eyes, his arms bare, his clothes torn, his
vibrant voice resounding from wall to wall and from bastion
to bastion, till something of his own fire was communicated
to all those who fought under his command.
</p>

<p>
To Jacqueline he was still so marvellously, so powerfully
alive, even though his body lay stark and still at the foot
of those walls which he had so bravely defended.  He seemed
to be smiling down on her from the clear blue of the sky,
to nod at her with those banners which he had helped to
keep unsullied before the foe.  She heard his voice through
the lengthy perorations of Monseigneur, the murmured
approbation of the Provosts, through the cheers of the people.
She felt his presence now as she had felt it through the
past four weary months, while Cambray suffered and
starved, and bore starvation and misery with that
fortitude which he had infused into her.
</p>

<p>
And while Monseigneur the governor spoke his preliminary
harangue, to which the people listened in silence, she
stood firm and ready to speak the words which, in accordance
with the quaint and ancient Flemish custom, would
betroth her irrevocably to the man chosen for her by her
guardians, even though he happened to be absent at the
moment.  For her, those words, the solemn act, would
only register the vow which she had made long ago, the
vow which bound her soul for ever to the hero who had
gone.
</p>

<p>
'It is my purpose,' Monseigneur said solemnly, 'to plight
this my lawful ward, Jacqueline, Dame de Broyart et de
Morchipont, Duchesse et Princesse de Ramèse, d'Espienne
et de Wargny, unto His Royal Highness, Hercule François
de Valois, Duc d'Alençon et d'Anjou, and I hereby desire
to ask the members of my Council to give their consent to
this decree.'
</p>

<p>
And the Chief Magistrate, speaking in the name of the
States General and of the City and Provincial Council,
then gave answer:
</p>

<p>
'Before acceding to your request, Monseigneur, we
demand to know whether Hercule François of Valois, Duc
d'Alençon et d'Anjou, is an honourable man, and possessed
of sufficient goods to ensure that Madame Jacqueline de
Broyart et de Morchipont, Duchesse et Princesse de Ramèse,
d'Espienne et de Wargny, continue to live as she hath done
hitherto and in a manner befitting her rank.'
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Messire de Balagny made reply:
</p>

<p>
'His Royal Highness is a prince of the House of France;
he defended our city in the hour of her gravest peril and
saved her from destruction and from the fury of our Spanish
foe.  He is in every way worthy to have our ward for
wife.'
</p>

<p>
'Wherefore, most honourable seigneurs,' continued the
governor solemnly, 'I do desire by your favour to grant
the hand of Madame Jacqueline to him in marriage.'
</p>

<p>
'This request we would grant you, Monseigneur,' rejoined
the Chief Magistrate, 'but would ask you first how it comes
that the bridegroom himself is not here to claim his bride.'
</p>

<p>
'The bridegroom,' replied d'Inchy, slowly and loudly,
so that his voice could be heard, clear and distinct, in every
corner of the great courtyard.  'The bridegroom is even at
this hour within sight of our beleaguered city.  He is at
the head of his armies and only waits a favourable
opportunity for demanding from the Spanish commander that the
latter do give him battle.  The bridegroom, I say, hath
sent us a token of his goodwill and an assurance that he
will not tarry.  He hath asked that Madame Jacqueline
do plight her troth to him before the assembled people of
Cambray, so that they may know that he is true and
faithful unto them and take heart of courage against his speedy
coming for their deliverance.'
</p>

<p>
A murmur&mdash;it could not be called a cheer, for voices
were hoarse and spent&mdash;went the round of the crowd.  There
were nods of approval; and a gleam of hope, almost of
joy, lit up many a wan face and many a sunken eye.  After
so many deceptions, so much weary waiting and hope
deferred, this was at least something tangible, something
to cling to, whilst battling against the demons of hunger
and disease which so insidiously called for surrender.
</p>

<p>
The Chief Magistrate, who together with Monseigneur
had been chiefly instrumental in engineering the present
situation, waited for a moment or two, giving time for the
governor's cheering words to soak well into the minds of
the people.  He was a tall, venerable-looking old burgher,
with a white beard clipped close to his long, thin face, and
a black velvet bonnet, now faded to a greenish hue by
exposure to all weathers, set upon his scanty hair.  He drew
up his bent shoulders and threw back his head with a gesture
expressive both of confidence and of determination, and
he allowed his deep-set eyes beneath their bushy brows to
wander over the populace, as if to say: 'See how right I
was to bid you hope!  Here you have an actual proof that
the end of your sufferings is in sight, that the deliverance
for which you pray is already at your gate!'  After which,
he turned once again to d'Inchy and said loftily:
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur the governor! the people of Cambray here
assembled have heard with profound respect the declaration
which you have deigned to make, as to the intentions of
His Royal Highness the Duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon.  On
their behalf and on the behalf of the States of this Town
and Province whom I represent, I hereby affirm most
solemnly that we have the weal of our city at heart; that
we will resist the armies of the Duke of Parma with the
whole might of our arms and our will, awaiting tranquilly
and with fortitude the hour of our deliverance.  We trust
and believe that he who defended us so valiantly four months
ago will soon return to us, and rid us once and for ever
from the menace of our foe.'
</p>

<p>
Once more a murmur of approval went round the Place.
Wearied, aching heads nodded approval; firm lips, thin
and pale, were set with a recrudescence of energy.  All
the stoicism of this heroic race was expressed in their
simple acceptance of this fresh term of endurance imposed
upon them, in their willingness to hope on again, to wait
and to submit, and in their mute adhesion to the profession
of faith loudly proclaimed by their Chief dignitary:
'awaiting tranquilly and with fortitude the hour of our
deliverance.'
</p>

<p>
'And now, Monseigneur,' concluded the Magistrate
impressively, 'in the name of your Council, I herewith make
acceptance of His Royal Highness, Hercule François of
Valois, Duc d'Alençon et d'Anjou, prince of the House of
France, defender and saviour of Cambray, to be the future
husband and guardian of Madame Jacqueline de Broyart,
our ward.'
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur the governor now drew his sword, held it
upright and placed on it a hat and round his arm a mantle;
then he took the ring, which had been borrowed from the
city treasury for the occasion, and hung it on a projecting
ornament of his sword-hilt.  After which he said, with
great solemnity:
</p>

<p>
'With these emblems I hereby entrust to His Royal
Highness Hercule François de Valois, Duc d'Anjou et
d'Alençon, prince of the House of France, the defender and
saviour of Cambray in the hour of her gravest peril, the
custody of my ward Jacqueline, Dame de Broyart et de
Morchipont, Duchesse et Princesse de Ramèse, d'Espienne
et de Wargny; and as I have been her faithful custodian
in the past, so do I desire him to become her guardian and
protector henceforth, taking charge of her worldly possessions
and duly administering them faithfully and loyally.'
</p>

<p>
After which he lowered his sword, put down the hat and
the mantle and presented the ring to Jacqueline, together
with seven gloves, saying the while:
</p>

<p>
'Jacqueline, take these in exchange for the emblems of
marital authority which I herewith hold for and on behalf
of your future lord, and in the presence of all the people
of Cambray here assembled, I demand that you do plight
your troth to him and that you swear to be true and faithful
unto him, to love and cherish him with your heart and
your body, to obey and serve him loyally as his wife and
helpmate, until death.'
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline, by all the canons of this quaint custom,
should have held the ring and the gloves in her left hand
and taken the solemn oath with her right raised above her
head.  Instead of which, Manuchet assures us that she laid
down the ring and the gloves upon the chair nearest to her,
and clasped her two hands together as if in prayer.  She
raised her small head and looked out upon the sky&mdash;there
where the setting sun hid its glory behind a filmy veil of
rose-tinted clouds.
</p>

<p>
'In the name of the living God who made me,' she said,
with solemn and earnest fervour, 'I do hereby plight my
troth to my lord, the noble and puissant hero who defended
Cambray in the hour of her gravest peril, who saved her
from destruction and taught her citizens how to conquer
and to endure, and I swear upon my life and upon my every
hope of salvation that I will be true and faithful unto him,
that I will love and cherish him with my heart and with
my body and will serve him loyally and unswervingly now
and alway until our souls meet in the presence of God.'
</p>

<p>
A great hush had fallen on the vast courtyard while
Jacqueline de Broyart made her profession of faith; nor did
a sound mar the perfect stillness which lay over the heavy-laden
city.  This was a time of great silences&mdash;silence of
sorrow, of anxiety and pain.  The women frankly gave
way to tears; but they were tears that fell soundlessly
from hollow eyes.  The men did not weep&mdash;they just
set their teeth, and culled in that one woman's fervour fresh
power for their own endurance.
</p>

<p>
The city dignitaries crowded round Jacqueline, kissing
and pressing her hands.  Monseigneur the governor was
looking greatly relieved.  From the tower of Notre Dame,
the bells set forth a joyous peal&mdash;the first that had been
heard for many months.  And that peal was presently
taken up, first by one church tower and then another, from
St. Waast to St. Martin, Ste. Croix to St. Géry.  The happy
sound echoed and reverberated along the city walls, broke
with its insidious melody the gloomy silence which had
lain over the streets like a pall.
</p>

<p>
Far away in the west the sun was slowly sinking in a
haze of translucent crimson, and tipped every church spire,
every bastion and redoubt with rose and orange and gold.
For the space of a few more minutes the citadel with
its breathless and fervid crowd, with its waving banners
and grey walls, was suffused as with a flush of life and hope.
Then the shadows lengthened&mdash;longer and longer they grew,
deeper and more dense, like great, drab arms that enfold
and conceal and smother.  Slowly the crimson glow faded
out of the sky.
</p>

<p>
Now the group in the centre appeared only like a sombre
mass of dull and lifeless colours; Jacqueline's white satin
gown took on a leaden hue; the brilliance of the sky had
become like a presage of storm.  The women shivered
beneath their ragged kerchiefs; some of the children started
to cry.
</p>

<p>
Then, one by one, the crowd began to disperse.  Walking,
halting, crawling, they wended their way back to their
dreary homes,&mdash;there to wait again, to suffer and to endure;
there to conceal all the heroism of this patient resignation,
all the stoicism of a race which no power could conquer,
no tyranny force into submission.
</p>

<p>
And once more silence descended on the hapless city,
and the mantle of night lay mercifully upon her grievous
wounds.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
VIII
</h4>

<p>
And far away in the Spanish camps, the soldiers and their
captains marvelled how joy-bells could be ringing in a city
which was in the throes of her death agony.  But the Duke
of Parma knew what it meant, as did the members of his
staff&mdash;del Fuente, his second in command, de Salvado,
Bracamonte, de Landas and the others.  More than one
of their wily spies had succeeded before now in swimming
across the Schelde and in scaling the tumble-down walls
of the heroic city, and had brought back the news of what
was doing in there, in the midst of a starving and obstinate
population.
</p>

<p>
'The public betrothal to a fickle Prince who will never
come,' said the Duke grimly, between his teeth.  'At any
rate, not before we have worked our will with those mulish
rebels.'
</p>

<p>
'We could take their pestilent town by storm to-morrow,'
remarked de Landas, with a note of fierce hatred in his
voice, 'if your Highness would but give the order.'
</p>

<p>
'Bah!' retorted the Duke.  'Let them rot!  Why
should we waste valuable lives and precious powder, when
the next few days must see the final surrender of that peccant
rat-hole?'
</p>

<p>
He gave a coarse laugh and shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'I believe,' he said to de Landas, 'that I once promised
you Cambray and all that it contains&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
'For ridding your Highness of the abominable rebel
who organized the defence last April,' assented de Landas.
'Yes!  Cambray and all that it contains was to be my
reward.'
</p>

<p>
'You killed the miscreant, I believe?'
</p>

<p>
'I shot him through the heart.  He lies rotting now
beneath the walls.'
</p>

<p>
'Well!' riposted the Duke.  'You earned your reward
easily enough.  There will be plenty left in Cambray,
even after I have had my first pick of its treasures.'
</p>

<p>
De Landas made no protest.  It would have been not
only useless, but also impolitic to remind His Highness
that, at the moment when he offered Cambray and all its
contents to the man who would rid him of a valiant foe,
he had made no proviso that he himself should fill his pockets
first.  There was no honour among these thieves and no
probity in these savage tyrants&mdash;brute beasts, most of them,
who destroyed and outraged whatever resisted their might.
So de Landas held his tongue; for even so, he was not
dissatisfied.  The Duke, being rid of the rebel whom he feared,
might easily have repudiated the ignoble bargain in its
entirety, and de Landas would have had no redress.
</p>

<p>
As it was, there was always Jacqueline.  The Spanish
commanders were wont to make short shrift of Flemish
heiresses who happened to be in a city which they entered
as conquerors.  By decree of His Highness, Jacqueline de
Broyart would certainly be allocated to him&mdash;de Landas&mdash;if
he chose to claim her.  Of a truth, she was still well
worth having&mdash;more so than ever, perhaps; for her spirit
now would be chastened by bodily privations, broken by
humiliation at the hands of the faithless Valois and by the
death of her mysterious lover.
</p>

<p>
'So long as the heiress is there for me,' he said carelessly
to the Duke, 'I am satisfied to let every other treasure
go.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! you shall have the heiress,' riposted His Highness
hilariously.  'Rumour hath described her as passing fair.
You lucky devil!  Methinks you were even betrothed to
her once.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! long ago, your Highness.  Since then the oily
promises of the Duc d'Anjou have helped to erase my image
from the tablets of Madame Jacqueline's heart.'
</p>

<p>
'Then she'll be all the more ready to fall back into your
arms, now that she has discovered the value of a Valois
prince's faith.'
</p>

<p>
After which pronouncement, the Duke of Parma dismissed
the matter from his mind and turned his attention
to the table, richly spread with every kind of delicacy,
which had been laid for him in his tent.  He invited the
gentlemen of his staff to sit, and as he dug his fork into
the nearest succulent dish, he said complacently:
</p>

<p>
'Those pestiferous rebels out there cannot have as much
as a mouse between the lot of them, to fill their Flemish
paunches.  Messeigneurs, here is to Cambray!' he added,
as he lifted his silver goblet filled to the brim with Rhenish
wine.  'To Cambray, when we march through her streets,
ransack her houses and share her gold!  To Cambray, and
the pretty Flemish wenches, if so be they have an ounce
of flesh left upon their bones!  To de Landas' buxom heiress
and his forthcoming marriage with her!  To you all, and
the spoils which these many months of weary waiting will
help you to enjoy!  To Cambray, all ye gallant seigneurs!'
</p>

<p>
His lusty toast was greeted with loud laughter.  Metal
goblets clicked one against the other, every one drank to
the downfall of the rebellious city.  De Landas accepted
the jocose congratulations of his boon-companions.  He,
too, raised his goblet aloft, and having shouted: 'To
Jacqueline!' drained it to its last drop.
</p>

<p>
But when he set the goblet down, his hand was shaking
perceptibly.  Cain-like, he had seen a vision of the man
whom he had so foully murdered.  Accidentally he knocked
over a bottle of red Burgundy, which stood on the table
close by, and the linen cloth all around him was spread
over with a dark crimson stain, which to the assassin
appeared like the colour of blood.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><br />
WHAT VALUE A VALOIS PRINCE SET UPON HIS WORD
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
To Gilles de Crohin, when he woke to consciousness one
morning in his former lodging in La Fère, the whole
of the past few weeks appeared indeed like a long dream.
</p>

<p>
Cambray&mdash;Jacqueline&mdash;his mask&mdash;his deceit&mdash;that last
day upon the ramparts&mdash;were they not all the creations of
his fevered brain?  Surely a whole lifetime could not be
crowded into so short a space of time.  No man could have
lived through so much, loved so passionately, have lost and
fought and conquered so strenuously, all within a few weeks.
</p>

<p>
And when, after many days' enforced rest and a good
deal of attention from a skilful leech backed by Maître
Jehan's unwavering care, he was once more on his feet and
was able to relate to Madame la Reyne de Navarre the many
vicissitudes of his perilous adventure, it seemed to him as
if he were recounting to a child, fairy tales and dream stories
which had never been.
</p>

<p>
It was only at evening, when he wandered round the little
Dutch garden at the back of the house where he lodged,
that Jacqueline came to him, aglow with life&mdash;a living,
breathing, exquisite reality.  For the Madonna lilies were
all abloom in that garden just then: tall, stately white
lilies, which bordered one of the narrow paths.  They had
slender, pale green stems, their fragrance filled the evening
air and the soft breeze stirred their delicate crowns.  Then
it would seem to Gilles as if his Jacqueline were walking
down the path beside him, that the breeze blew the tendrils
of her fair hair against his nostrils and that her voice filled
his ear with its sweet, melodious sound.  A big heartache
would make the rough soldier sigh with longing then.
Unseen by any one, alone with his thoughts of her, he would
stretch out his arms to that tantalizing vision which seemed
so real and was yet so far, so very far away.
</p>

<p>
Madame la Reyne would at times chaff him about his
moodiness, and he himself was ready to laugh aloud at his
own folly.  What right had he&mdash;the uncouth soldier of
fortune, the homeless adventurer&mdash;to think of the great
and noble lady, who was as far removed from him as were
the stars?  What right indeed?  Even though Marguerite
de Navarre, lavish in her gratitude, had already showered
honours and wealth upon the man who had served her so
faithfully.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur le Prince de Froidmont,' she had said to
him with solemn earnestness, on the day when first she had
realized how completely he had worked out her own schemes;
'the lands of Froide Monte, which are some of the richest
in Acquitaine, were a part of my dowry when I married.
They are yours now, as they once were the property of
your forebears.  They are yours, with their forests, their
streams and their castles.  Take them as a poor token of
my lifelong gratitude.'  And when Gilles demurred,
half-indifferent even to so princely a gift, she added with her
habitual impatience: 'Pardieu, Messire, why should you
be too proud to accept a gift from me, seeing that I was
not too proud to ask so signal a service of you?'
</p>

<p>
Even so, that gift&mdash;so graciously offered, so welcome to
the man's pride of ancestry&mdash;had but little value in his
sight, since he could not do with it the one thing that
mattered, which was to lay it at Jacqueline's feet.
</p>

<p>
'Do not look so morose, Messire,' Marguerite de Navarre
said teasingly.  'I vow that you have left your heart
captive in Cambray.'  Then as Gilles, after this straight
hit, remained silent and absorbed, she added gaily: 'Have
no fear, Messire!  When <i>Monsieur</i> is Lord of the Netherlands,
he will force the lady of your choice into granting
you her favours.  Remember!' she said more seriously,
'that the Prince de Froidmont can now aspire to the hand
of the richest and most exalted lady in the land.'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur is still far from being Lord of the Netherlands,'
Gilles said dryly, chiefly with a view to inducing a
fresh train of thought in the royal lady's mind.
</p>

<p>
Marguerite shrugged her pretty shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'He still procrastinates,' she admitted.  'He should be
at La Fère by now, with five thousand troops.  Everything
was ready when I left Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'He has found something else to distract him,' rejoined
Gilles, with unconscious bitterness.  'Perhaps Mme. de
Marquette has resumed her sway over him, the while
Cambray waits and starves.'
</p>

<p>
'Chien sabe?' allowed Madame la Reyne with an
impatient sigh.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
The while Cambray waits and starves!  That was indeed
the deathly sting which poisoned Gilles de Crohin's very
life during those four dreary months, while <i>Monsieur</i> Duc
d'Anjou was ostensibly making preparations for his expedition
for the relief of the beleaguered city.  Ostensibly in
truth, for very soon his fond sister had to realize that,
now as always, that fickle brother of hers was playing his
favourite game of procrastination and faithlessness.  With
him, in fact, faithlessness had become an obsession.  It
seemed as if he could not act or think straight, as if he
could not keep his word.  Now, while he was supposed to
recruit his troops, to consult with his officers, to provide
for engines and munitions of war, he actually deputed his
long-suffering and still faithful friend, Gilles de Crohin,
to do the work for him.  His own thoughts had once more
turned to a possible marriage&mdash;not with Jacqueline de
Broyart, to whom he was bound by every conceivable tie
of honour and of loyalty&mdash;but with Elizabeth of England,
whom he coveted because of her wealth, and the power
which so brilliant an alliance would place in his hands.
</p>

<p>
But of these thoughts he did not dare to speak even to
the adoring sister, who most certainly would have turned
her back on him for ever had she known that he harboured
such dishonourable projects.  He did not dare to speak of
them even to Gilles, for he felt that this would strain his
friend's loyalty to breaking point.  He entered outwardly
into the spirit of the proposed expedition with all the zest
which he could muster, but the moment he was no longer
under Marguerite de Navarre's own eyes he did not lift
another finger in its organization.
</p>

<p>
'Turenne and la Voute are quite capable of going to the
relief of Cambray without me,' he said to Gilles with a yawn
and a lazy stretch of his long, loose limbs.  'I have never
been counted a good commander, and Parma is always a
difficult problem to tackle.  Let Turenne go, I say.  My
brother Henri lauds him as the greatest general of the day,
and the rogue hath fought on the Spanish side before now,
so he hath all their tricks at his fingers' ends.'
</p>

<p>
<i>Monsieur</i> was in Paris then, and Marguerite de Navarre,
wellnigh distraught, had entreated Gilles to stir him into
immediate activity.
</p>

<p>
'Cambray will fall before that indolent brother of mine
gets there, Messire,' she had pleaded, with tears of impotent
anger in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Gilles had gone.  He needed no goad even for so
distasteful a task.  'Cambray might fall!'  The thought
drove him into a fever, from which he could find no solace
save in breathless activity.  He found <i>Monsieur</i> in his
Palace in Paris, surrounded by the usual crowd of effeminate
youngsters and idle women, decked out in new-fangled,
impossible clothes, the creations of his own fancy, indolent,
vicious, incorrigible.  Just now, when Gilles had come to
speak to him of matters that meant life or death, honour
or shame, the future welfare or downfall of a nation, he was
lounging in a huge armchair, his feet resting on a pile of
cushions.  He was wearing one of his favourite satin suits,
with slashed doublet all covered with tags and ribbons;
he had gold earrings in his ears and was nursing a litter
of tiny hairless puppies, whom he was teasing with the
elaborate insignia of the Order of the Holy Ghost, wrought
in gold and set with diamonds, which he wore on a blue
ribband round his neck.
</p>

<p>
Gilles looked down on him with a contempt that was
no longer good-humoured.  Cambray was waiting and
starving whilst this miserable coxcomb idled away the
hours!  Two months had gone by and practically nothing
had been done.  There were no troops, no munitions, no
arms; and Cambray was waiting and starving!  God
alone knew what miseries were being endured by those
valiant burghers over there, whom Gilles' own voice had
so easily rallied once to a stubborn and heroic defence!
God alone knew what his exquisite Jacqueline was being
made to suffer!  At the thought, his very soul writhed in
torment.  He could have raised his hands in measureless
anger against that effeminate nincompoop, and crushed the
last spark of a profligate and useless life out of him.  As
it was, he had to entreat, to argue, almost to kneel, pleading
the cause of Cambray and of his proud Jacqueline&mdash;his
perfect and unapproachable lily, whom this miserable rag
of manhood was casting aside and spurning with a careless
wave of the hand.
</p>

<p>
Ye gods!  That he, of all men, should have been assigned
such a rôle!  That Fate should have destined him to plead
for the very honour and safety of the woman whom he
worshipped, with a man whom he despised!  And yet he
argued and he entreated because Madame la Reyne herself
vowed that no one could keep her brother in the path of
integrity now, except his friend Gilles de Crohin.  She had
begged him not to leave Monsieur, not for a day, not if
possible for an hour!
</p>

<p>
'He will give us the slip again,' she begged most earnestly;
'and be off to England after his wild-goose chase.
Elizabeth will never marry him&mdash;never!  And we shall remain
before the world, uselessly discredited and shamed.'
</p>

<p>
Alas! much precious time had in the meanwhile been
lost.  News had come through that the Duke of Parma
had given up the thought of taking Cambray by storm and
had left del Fuente in temporary command with orders
to reduce her by starvation.
</p>

<p>
But this was two months ago.
</p>

<p>
Marguerite de Navarre, wearied to death, harassed by
<i>Monsieur's</i> inactivity, obstructed by the King of France,
was on the verge of despair.  Cambray, according to the
most haphazard calculations, must be on the point of
surrender.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Early in July, <i>Monsieur</i>, stung into a semblance of
activity by perpetual nagging from his sister and constant
goading from Gilles, did send M. de Turenne with an
insufficient force, ill-equipped and ill-found, to effect a
surprise attack against the Spanish army.
</p>

<p>
We know how signally that failed.  The blame naturally
was lavishly distributed.  M. de Turenne, ignorant of his
ground, had, it was averred, employed guides who led him
astray.  Spies and traitors amongst his troops were also
supposed to have got wind of his plans and to have betrayed
them to the Spanish commander.  Certain it is that Turenne's
small force was surprised, cut up, Turenne himself taken
prisoner and that la Voute, his second, only escaped a like
fate by disguising himself as a woman and running with
the best of them back to La Fère.
</p>

<p>
The blow had fallen, sudden, swift and terrible.  When
the news was brought to Marguerite of Navarre she was
seized with so awful an attack of choler, that she fell into
unconsciousness and had to take to her bed.
</p>

<p>
She sent for Gilles, who was eating out his heart in Paris,
playing the watch-dog over a dissolute Prince.  At her
command he proceeded at once to La Fère.
</p>

<p>
'All is not lost, Messire,' she said to him, as soon as his
calm, trust-inspiring presence had infused some semblance
of hope into her heart.  'But we must not allow <i>Monsieur</i>
to exert himself any more in the matter.  His incapacity
alone matches his indolence.'
</p>

<p>
She felt so ashamed and so humiliated, that Gilles wellnigh
forgot the grudge, which he really owed her for that
pitiable adventure into which she had thrust him, and
which was even now ending in disaster.
</p>

<p>
'My spirit is wellnigh broken,' she continued, with
pathetic self-depreciation.  'If only, out of all this misery,
we could save one shred of our honour!'
</p>

<p>
'Will your Majesty let me try?' Gilles said simply.
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?' she riposted.
</p>

<p>
'Let me gather an army together.  Let me do battle
against the Duke of Parma.  Monseigneur hath proved
himself unwilling.  We court disaster by allowing him thus
to fritter away both time and men.  It was Turenne
yesterday; it will be Condé to-morrow, or Montmorency or
Bussy&mdash;anybody, any unfortunate or incompetent who is
willing to serve him!  In God's name, Madame la Reyne,'
urged Gilles, with a tone of bitter reproach, 'do not let us
procrastinate any longer!  Cambray is in her death-agony.
Let <i>me</i> go to her aid!'
</p>

<p>
She made a final, half-hearted protest.
</p>

<p>
'No!  No!' she said.  'You cannot, must not leave
your post.  If you do not keep watch over <i>Monsieur</i>, we
shall lose him altogether.'
</p>

<p>
'Better that,' he retorted grimly, 'than that we should
lose Cambray.'
</p>

<p>
'There you are right, Messire.  Cambray now is bound
up with our honour.'
</p>

<p>
She had become like a child&mdash;so different to her former
self-assured, almost arrogant self.  Gilles, whose firm
purpose gave him the strength, had little ado to mould her
to his will.  She had become malleable, yielding, humble
in her helplessness.  Marguerite de Navarre was actually
ready to listen to advice, to let another think for her and
scheme.  She accepted counsel with a blindness and
submissiveness which were truly pathetic.  And Gilles&mdash;with
the vision before him of Jacqueline enduring all the horrors
of a protracted siege&mdash;was experiencing a semblance of
happiness at thought that at last he would have the power
of working for her.  So he set to with a will, to make the
harassed Queen see eye to eye with him, to make her enter
into his ideas and his plans.
</p>

<p>
'Your Majesty,' he said, 'has offered me the richest
lands in Aquitaine.  I entreat you to take them back and
to give me their worth in money, and I'll gather together
an army that will know how to fight.  Then, when we are
sure of victory, <i>Monsieur</i> can come and himself take
command.  But in the meanwhile, we will beat the Duke of
Parma and relieve Cambray.  This I swear to you by the
living God!'
</p>

<p>
Marguerite was soon swept off her feet by his determination
and his enthusiasm.  With naïve surrender, she laid
down her burden and left Gilles to shoulder it.  Now at
last he could work for his Jacqueline!  He could fight for
her, die for her when the time came!  He could drive the
foe from her gates and bequeath to her, ere he fell, the
freedom of the country she loved so well.
</p>

<p>
Night and day he toiled, not only with heart and will
but with the frenzy of despair; while Marguerite, ever
hopeful, ever deluded where that contemptible brother
of hers was concerned, flew to Paris to keep a watch over
him, then back to La Fère to concert with Gilles&mdash;hoping
against hope that all would still be well, ready to forgive
Monsieur even for the seventy times seventh time, confident
that she would still see him entering Cambray and marching
thence from city to city, the chosen Lord of the
Netherlands, more puissant than any King.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
On the last day of July, Gilles de Crohin had his forces
ready, equipped, armed, provisioned, at La Fère, where
Marguerite de Navarre came herself in order to wish him
and the expedition God speed.
</p>

<p>
But <i>Monsieur</i>&mdash;who had promised, nay sworn, he would
come too, in order to take command in person at the last,
when victory was assured&mdash;<i>Monsieur</i> had not arrived.
</p>

<p>
For two sennights the devoted sister and the faithful
friend waited for him; but he did not come.  Marguerite
sent courier upon courier after him to Paris, but he evaded
them all, and at one time nobody knew where he had hidden
himself.  To his other vices and failings, this descendant
of a once noble race had added the supreme act of a coward.
What that final weary waiting meant for Gilles, not even a
veracious chronicler can describe.  With Cambray almost in
sight, with the Spanish armies not two leagues away, with
his Jacqueline enduring every horror and every misery
which the aching heart of an absent lover can conjure up
before his tortured mind, he was forced to remain in
idleness, eating out his heart in regret, remorse and longing,
doubtful as to what the future might bring, tortured even
with the fear that, mayhap, in Cambray only a flower-covered
mound of earth would mark the spot where his
Jacqueline slept the last sleep of eternal rest.
</p>

<p>
Then at last, upon the fourteenth day of August, a letter
came by runner from <i>Monsieur</i>, for the Queen of Navarre.
It had been written in Paris more than a week ago, and
obviously had been purposely delayed.  It began with
many protestations of good-will, of love for his sister and
of confidence in his friend.  Then the letter went on in a
kind of peevish strain:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
'I am quite convinced, My dear sister, that I am altogether
unfit for the kind of attack which the present Situation
demands.  Now Gilles has a great deal more Energy than I
have, and a great deal more Knowledge.  As you know, I
never had any longing for military Glory, and feel absolutely
no desire to make a State Entry into Cambray with a swarm
of starved or diseased Flemings hanging to my
stirrup-leathers.  Let Gilles to all that.  He seems to have had a
liking for that unsavoury Crowd.  Then, by and by, if the
Spaniards, in the meanwhile, do not frustrate his Designs by
giving him a beating, I shall be ready to take up once more
the negotiations for my proposed Sovereignty of the
Netherlands.  But understand, My dear Sister, that this happy
Event must come to pass without the co-operation of a
Flemish bride.  Frankly, I have no liking for the Race, and
would be jeopardising My whole Future, by selling Myself
to the first Dutch wench that an untoward Fate would throw
in My way.  Entre nous, Elizabeth of England has not been
so haughty with Me of late.  Get Me that Kingdom of the
Netherlands by all means, My dear.  I verily believe that
this accrued Dignity would ensure the favourable Acceptance
of My suit by the English Queen.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Marguerite had never made any secret before Gilles of
her brother's perfidy.  Even this infamous letter she placed
loyally before him now.  When he had finished reading
it and she saw the look of measureless contempt which flashed
through his eyes, she could have cried with shame and
misery.
</p>

<p>
'What to do, Messire?' she exclaimed piteously.  'Oh,
my God! what to do?'
</p>

<p>
'Relieve Cambray first and foremost, Madame,' he
replied firmly.  'After that, we shall see.'
</p>

<p>
'But the Flemish lords!' she rejoined.  'Their anger!
Their contempt!  I could not bear it, Messire!  The shame
of it all will kill me!'
</p>

<p>
'It has got to be borne, Madame!  Cambray has suffered
enough.  It is our turn now.'
</p>

<p>
Nor would he discuss the matter any further, even with
her.  The expedition had been entrusted to his hands,
and nothing would delay him now.  Cambray was waiting
and starving, every hour might mean her final surrender.
The Spanish commander&mdash;apprised of <i>Monsieur</i> le Duc
d'Anjou's arrival with a strong force&mdash;had already offered
battle.  Gilles was only too eager to accept the issue.
</p>

<p>
On the fifteenth day of August, 1581, that battle was
fought on the plains outside Cambray.  The issue was never
in doubt for one moment.  Le Carpentier asserts that the
Duke of Parma, after six hours' stubborn fighting, surrendered
his position and all his forts and retired in great haste
in the direction of Valenciennes.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><br />
AND THIS IS THE END OF MY STORY
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
And into the silent desolation of Cambray's deserted
streets, there penetrated once again the sounds of
that life which was teeming outside her walls.  From the
north and the south, from the east and the west, rumour,
like a wily sprite, flew over the crumbling walls and
murmured into ears that scarcely heard, that the promise given
long ago was being redeemed at last.  Anxiety, sorrow and
suffering were coming to an end, so the elf averred.  The
hero who fought and conquered once, had returned to
conquer again.
</p>

<p>
Whereupon, those who had enough strength left in them
to drag themselves along, found their way to the ramparts,
from whence they could watch the approach of the man
who would bring them liberty if he succeeded, or bequeath
them an heroic death if he failed.  There was no other
issue possible.  The sands of Cambray's endurance had
run down; she had no more resistance left in her, scarcely
the power to suffer any longer.  If the relieving army failed
to-day, the setting sun would see the Spanish soldiery,
drunk with victory, swarming over the lonely streets,
destroying all that famine and disease had left whole, all
that a dying population had no longer the strength to defend.
</p>

<p>
Little could be seen of what went on in the distant plain,
and hollow eyes, wearied with weeping and anxiety, scanned
in vain the horizon far away.  But those who had come
to watch remained to pray, while their minds, rendered
super-sensitive by bodily want, conjured up visions of
that grim fight which was going on beyond their range of
vision.
</p>

<p>
The history of this heroic people has no more poignant
page than that which tells of this long watch by a crowd
of miserable, half-starved people, the while, out there upon
the plain, brave men fought and died for their sake.
</p>

<p>
Not only for their sake, but for the honour of France.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Once more the roar of artillery and of musketry fills the
air with its awe-inspiring sound.  It is early morning, and
the sky heavily overcast.  To the anxious watchers, that
grim struggle out there is only a dimly-perceived confusion,
a medley of sights and sounds, a clash of arms, the dull
thunder of culverines and sharp report of musketry.  And,
as the grey light of day begins to pick out with crude
precision the more distant objects, a kaleidoscope of colour
vies in brilliancy with the flash of steel, and tears asunder
the drab mist which lies upon the bosom of the plain.
</p>

<p>
The yellow and red of the Spaniards becomes easily
distinguishable, then the white and blue and gold of the
French, the green of the arquebusiers, the black of the
archers, and even that tiny moving speck, more brilliant
even than the gleam of metal, the white banner of France,
sown with her Fleur de Lys.
</p>

<p>
But the watchers up on the ramparts vainly strain their
hollow eyes to see the man who has come to save Cambray.
They can only guess that he is there, where the fight is
fiercest, where death stands most grim and most relentless.
They have a knowledge of his presence keener than sight
can give, and though voices at this hour are spent and
hoarse with pain, yet to every roar of cannon, to every
volley of musketry, there comes, like an answering murmur,
the triumphant call, which now sounds like a prayer and
which their hero taught them four months ago: 'Fleur de
Lys and Liberty!'
</p>

<p>
The French lancers and halberdiers rush the Spanish
forts.  The arquebusiers are fighting foot by foot; the
musketeers and archers stand firm&mdash;a living wall, which
deals death and remains unmoved, despite furious onslaughts
from a foe who appears to be desperate.  The plain around
is already strewn with dead.
</p>

<p>
The French have fought valiantly for close on six hours,
have repelled nine assaults against their positions, and now,
at one hour after noon, they still stand or crouch or kneel
on one knee, crossbow in hand or musket, they fire, fall
out, reform and fire again.  Shaken, battered, decimated,
they still shoot with coolness and precision, under the eye
of one who never tires.  Their ranks are still unbroken,
but the Spaniards are giving ground at last.
</p>

<p>
'This time we are undone!' Parma cries in the excess
of his rage.
</p>

<p>
He himself has been twice wounded; four of his young
officers have been killed.  The French musketeers, the
finest the world has ever seen, work relentlessly upon his
finest positions.  And he feels&mdash;this great captain, who
hitherto hath not known defeat&mdash;he feels that now at
last he has met his match.  Not a great leader like himself,
perhaps, not the victorious general in an hundred fights;
but a man whose stubbornness and daring, whose blind
disregard of danger and sublime defiance of evil fortune,
gives strength to the weakest and valour to the least bold.
</p>

<p>
'I thought you had rid me once of that pestilential
rebel!' he exclaims to de Landas, pointing to where
Gilles de Crohin's tall figure towers above the pressing
mass of Spanish halberdiers.
</p>

<p>
De Landas murmurs an imprecation, crosses himself in
an access of superstitious fear.
</p>

<p>
'My God!' he says under his breath.  'He hath risen
from the dead!'
</p>

<p>
In truth, Gilles appears endowed at this hour with
superhuman strength.  His doublet and jerkin are torn, his
breastplate riddled with arrow-shot, he bleeds profusely
from the hand, his face is unrecognizable under a coating
of smoke and grime.  Enthusiasm and obstinacy have
given him the power of giants; his hatred of the foe is
supreme; his contempt of death sublime.  De Landas sees
in him the incarnation of his own retributive destiny.
'Oh, that God's thunder would smite him where he
stands!' he mutters fervently.
</p>

<p>
''Tis too late now,' retorts Parma, with ferocious spite.
'Too late to call to God to help you.  You should have
bargained with the devil four months ago, when you missed
your aim.  Risen from the dead, forsooth!' he adds,
purple with fury.  'Very much alive now, meseems, and
with the strength of Satan in his arm.'
</p>

<p>
He strikes at de Landas with his sword, would have
killed him with his own hand, so enraged is he with the
man for his failure to murder an enemy whom he loathes
and fears.
</p>

<p>
'Unless those cowards rally,' he calls savagely, and
points to where, in the heart of the <i>mêlée</i>, confusion and
disorder wield their grisly sceptres, 'we shall have to
retreat.'
</p>

<p>
But de Landas does not stop to hear.  The fear of the
supernatural which had for the moment paralysed his
thinking faculties, is soon merged in that boundless hatred
which he feels for the rival whom he had thought dead
long ago.  In the heart of that confusion he has spied
Gilles, fighting, pursuing; slashing, hitting&mdash;intrepid and
superb, the centre and the life of the victorious army.  De
Landas sets spurs to his horse and, calling to his own troop
of swordsmen to follow, dashes into the <i>mêlée</i>.
</p>

<p>
The battle now is at its fiercest.  A proud army, superior
in numbers, in arms, in knowledge, feels itself weakening
before an enemy whose greatest power is his valour.  The
retreat has not yet sounded, but the Spanish captains all
know that the humiliating end is in sight.  Already their
pikemen have thrown down their cumbersome weapons.
Pursued by the French lancers, they turn and fight with
hands and fists, some of them; whilst others scatter in
every direction.  The ranks of their archers are broken,
and the fire of their musketeers has become intermittent
and weak.  Even the horsemen, the flower of Parma's
army, gentlemen all, are breaking in the centre.  With
reins loose, stirrup-leathers flapping, swords cast away and
mantles flying loose, they are making a stand which is
obviously the last, and which within the next few minutes
will with equal certainty turn into rout.
</p>

<p>
Here it is that Gilles is holding his own with a small
troop of French horsemen.  His steel bonnet has been
knocked off, his wounded arm roughly bandaged, the sleeves
of his jerkin fly behind him like a pair of wings, his invincible
sword strikes and flashes and gleams in the grey afternoon
light.
</p>

<p>
For a few seconds, while the distance between himself
and his enemy grows rapidly less, de Landas sees and hears
nothing.  The blood is beating in his temples, with a weird
thumping which drowns the din of battle.  His eyes are
blinded by a crimson veil; his hand, stiff and convulsed,
can scarcely grasp the pistol.  The next instant he is in
the very thick of the turmoil.
</p>

<p>
'For Spain and Our Lady!' he cries, and empties his
pistol into the seething mass of Spanish horsemen who bar
the way twixt him and his enemy.  The horsemen are
scattered.  Already on the verge of a stampede, they are
scared by this unexpected onslaught from the rear.  They
fear to be taken between cross-fires, are seized with panic,
turn and flee to right and left.  Two of them fall, hit by
that madman's pistol.  All is now tumult and a whirling
ferment.  The air is thick with smoke and powder, horses,
maddened with terror, snort and struggle and beat the air
with their hoofs.  De Landas' own troop join in the <i>mêlée</i>;
the French horsemen dash in pursuit; there is a scrimmage,
a stampede; men fight and tear and hit and slash, for dear
life and for safety.
</p>

<p>
But de Landas does not care, is past caring now.  Another
disaster more or less, another scare, final humiliation,
what matters?  The day is lost anyhow, and all his own
hopes finally dashed to the ground by the relief of Cambray
and the irrevocable loss to him of Jacqueline and her fortune.
Already he has thrown aside his smoking pistol, seized
another from the hand of his nearest follower, and points
it straight at Gilles.
</p>

<p>
'For Spain and Our Lady!'
</p>

<p>
'Fleur de Lys and Liberty!'
</p>

<p>
The two cries rang out simultaneously&mdash;then the report
of de Landas' pistol, and Gilles' horse hit in the neck,
suddenly swerves, rears and paws the air, and would have
thrown its rider had not the latter jumped clean out of
the saddle.
</p>

<p>
To de Landas' maddened gaze the smoke around appears
to be the colour of blood.  Blindly he gropes for another
pistol.  His henchman is near him, thrusts a weapon into
the young Spaniard's trembling hand.  For the fraction of
a second, destiny, waiting, stays her hand.  Gilles is free
of his struggling horse, he has his sword in his hand; but
de Landas once more points a pistol straight at him.
</p>

<p>
'Satan! guide thou my hand this time!' he calls out,
in a passion of fury.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly a raucous cry rises above the din; there
is a double, sharp report, a loud curse, a final groan of
despair and of rage, and de Landas, struck in the breast
by an almost savage blow from a lance, throws up his arms,
falls, first on his knees, then backwards on the soft earth,
would have been buried then and there under a seething
mass of struggling men and beasts, had not Gilles rushed
to him with one bound, caught him by the shoulders and
dragged his now lifeless body to comparative shelter a few
paces away.  Now Gilles picks up a fallen cloak from the
ground and lays it reverently over his fallen foe.
</p>

<p>
'Because Jacqueline loved you once,' he murmurs under
his breath.
</p>

<p>
Then he turns to his faithful Jehan.  'You were just in
time,' he says simply.
</p>

<p>
Jehan has been glancing down with mingled rage and
contempt on the man whom in his loyal heart he hated
in life with a wellnigh ferocious intensity.  Now he looks
at his master&mdash;his friend whom he loves&mdash;sees him on one
knee by the side of that abominable murderer, trying to
struggle back to his feet, but evidently weak and dizzy.
</p>

<p>
With a cry like an enraged tiger, Jehan casts his still
streaming lance away, is already kneeling beside Gilles,
supporting him in his arms as gently as a mother would
shelter her child.
</p>

<p>
'H-h-h-hurt?' he stammers laconically.  'That d-d-d-devil
hit you?'
</p>

<p>
'Only in the thigh,' replies Gilles.  'You diverted his
aim right enough, my dear Jehan!  And once more I owe
my life to you.  Just help me to get up,' he adds with his
wonted impatience.  'Do not let me miss another second
of the glorious spectacle of our victory!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Out in the western sky, a vivid band of blue and gold
breaks the bosom of the clouds.  The afternoon sun illumines
with its glowing rays the final rout of the Spanish army.
Le Carpentier's laconic words tell us more than any lengthy
chronicle could do.
</p>

<p>
'The Duke of Parma,' he says curtly, 'abandoned his
forts and retired in haste to Valenciennes.'
</p>

<p>
So much that was mighty and great and invincible has
succumbed before the power which comes from a sense
of justice, from valour and enthusiasm and the decrees of
God.  God has decided that Cambray has suffered enough;
He has broken the might of Parma and set an end to the
miseries of an heroic people.  And when, like a tidal wave
of steel, the Spanish troops begin to oscillate toward the
north, where lies Valenciennes and safety, up on the
ramparts of Cambray hundreds of men and women and children
fall on their knees, and thank God with fervour for their
freedom and for victory.
</p>

<p>
They are too weak to shout, too weak even to raise their
arms.  The pikemen lean upon their arms, the musketeers
upon their muskets, the gunners lie half-exhausted upon
their culverines.  Of the twenty-five thousand citizens
of Cambray, scarce fifteen thousand have remained to bid
the returning hero welcome.
</p>

<p>
Up in the fort of Cantimpré, the city guard&mdash;what is left
of it&mdash;wait for the entry of the victorious army.  The
bridge is lowered, the men stand as if on parade.  The city
fathers are there too, and amongst them stands Monseigneur
the governor.
</p>

<p>
Gaunt and careworn they all look.  Their ranks too have
been rudely thinned.  Monseigneur's hair is now
snow-white; the hand with which he leans upon a stick is
emaciated almost to the bone.  His other arm rests on that of
Jacqueline de Broyart, whose pale, wan face hath a curious
air of mystery and of detachment.
</p>

<p>
'Here they come!' Monseigneur says at last, as on the
horizon far away a glowing speck begins to move, to gather
shape as it draws nearer, catching, reflecting and throwing
back the roseate flashes of the setting sun.
</p>

<p>
The whole city now is watching; her very soul is in the
eyes of her expectant children.  A curious, nervous thrill
has taken the place of bodily exhaustion.  Only Jacqueline
stands quite silent and impassive.  Boundless gratitude
fills her heart for the deliverance of the city; but the
overwhelming joy which she feels is drowned in the immensity
of her sorrow.  For her, in truth, life is gone, happiness
lies buried beneath the city walls.  She can rejoice at the
coming of the man whom the people believe to be their
hero, but for her he is the stranger.  The real defender
of Cambray&mdash;her brave and spotless knight&mdash;gave his
precious life for her city all these weary months ago.
</p>

<p>
People crowd more insistently round her.  The speck
on the horizon has become a moving multitude.  Steel and
gold flash in the evening light, banners wave in the gentle,
summer breeze.  The French army, glorious after victory,
wends its way to the city which it has saved.
</p>

<p>
In the forefront march the halberdiers, with their blue
hose and huge, unwieldy trunks, small bonnets on their
heads and a cloak about their shoulders.  Then the pikemen,
in striped doublets, their enormous hats slung behind
their backs, and the musketeers with tall boots which reach
half-way up their thighs.  Immediately behind them comes
a long train of carts and waggons&mdash;the provisions collected
together for the starving city.  The Master of the Camp
is in charge of these.  He is mounted on a black charger,
surrounded by his staff.  The ends of his blue silk scarf
are smothered in dust, as are his boots and his plumed
hat.  Some way behind the waggons, the archers come,
marching three abreast, and then the foot-soldiers, with
huge steel gauntlets covering their hands, their heavy
lances borne upon their shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer the procession comes, and as it approaches,
a strange exultation born of weakness and of fever,
rises in the hearts of the watchers.  It seems as if an
unendurable weight were lifted from their shoulders, as if
they themselves had in a mysterious manner been dead
for weeks and months, and now had risen again in order
to gaze into the setting sun, from whence their liberator
had come to them again.
</p>

<p>
The streets are no longer deserted now.  Furtive forms,
gaunt and haggard, stand under doorways or congregate
upon the open places.  Women in ragged kirtles with
children clinging to their skirts, sick and maimed and halt
from disease and want, crawl out of the squalid houses to
watch the entry of the French troops.  Many, at sight of
those brave men all covered with smoke and powder and
dust, fall down on their knees and a long-forgotten prayer
rises to their lips.
</p>

<p>
Anon down the Bapaume road it is quite easy to perceive
the white banner sown with the gold Fleur de Lys.  It is
borne by a herald who sits upon a cream charger, and
immediately behind him a man rides alone.  He is hatless;
but he holds his head erect and looks straight out towards
the city.  He has the reins of his horse in one hand, the
other is hidden under his cloak.  Some little way behind
him ride a number of cavaliers in brilliant multi-coloured
doublets and hose, with drawn swords in their hands,
which flash and gleam in the setting sun.  They are still
close on half a league away, but adown the long, flat road
Monseigneur's keen eyes have already perceived them.
</p>

<p>
'It is His Highness the Duc d'Anjou!' he exclaims.
</p>

<p>
But, with a strange instinct which has for ever remained
inexplicable, Messire de Balagny retorts:
</p>

<p>
'It is the saviour of Cambray!'
</p>

<p>
And while he goes at once to transmit the governor's
orders that all the church bells in the city shall at once
begin to ring, Jacqueline de Broyart's gaze is fixed upon
the road which lies like a winding ribbon down below,
stretching as far as the glowing horizon far away.  The
sky is suffused with a joy-blush of crimson and orange
and gold, the sinking sun illumines with a roseate hue
that distant group of cavaliers, in the forefront of whom
rides the defender of Cambray.
</p>

<p>
After the turmoil of battle, an immense silence reigns
over the bosom of the plain.  Even the tramp of thousands
of men, the clatter of horses' hoofs and of arms, seem like
an integral part of that great and solemn silence, which has
its birth in the stricken city.  The victorious army has
entered Cambray, not with music and with cheering, not
with shouts of joy.  Joy is in every heart, but an abundance
of sorrow has stilled its outward expression.  The plain
itself is strewn with dead and wounded; hundreds of
valiant lives have been freely given for the deliverance of
Cambray.  Those that remain&mdash;some five thousand of
them&mdash;cross the bridge at the foot of Cantimpré, marching
three abreast.  It takes an hour for the first portion of the
victorious army to enter the city.  The service men bring
provision waggons in plenty, together with news that
more will follow as quickly as may be.  By nightfall there
would not be one hungry mouth left in Cambray.
</p>

<p>
Relief, content, the shadow of happiness, are too poignant
to find expression in words&mdash;perhaps they have come
just a little too late.  But gratitude is immense.  Soon the
streets of Cambray are encumbered with train and equipment,
with carts and waggons and barrows, horses loosely
tethered, litters of straw for the wounded and the ailing.
The distribution of the food is the most pressing need.
Everywhere men in faded, ragged clothing, with gaunt
faces and hollow eyes, hurry to the Grand' Place and to
the Marche aux Bois, where the food waggons are set up
under the eye of the Master of the Camp.
</p>

<p>
A pathetic procession of eager, half-starved shadows&mdash;women
and children too&mdash;with the humble, deprecating
air of the desperately indigent, crowd around the waggons.
Fifteen thousand mouths gaping for food.  There is only
a very little for everybody at first.  More will come
to-night.  More again to-morrow.  France, who has saved,
will also provide.  Of order there is none.  People push
and scamper as the hungry are wont to do, but all are too
feeble to do one another much harm.  The soldiers, flushed
with victory, are patient and good-natured.  My God! the
very aspect of the streets is enough to make any staunch
heart quake with horror!  Some of the men have wife
and family in far-off Artois or Provence.  They can hardly
restrain their tears as wee, grimy hands, thin to the bone,
are stretched out to them in pitiable eagerness.  They
are as lavish as they can be, giving up their own supper
to feed these unfortunates: generous now as they were
brave out there, when they fought under the eye of the
staunchest man they had ever seen in battle.
</p>

<p>
''Tis a fine candle you folk of Cambray owe to Monseigneur
de Froidmont!' the Master of the Camp says to a group
of burghers who, self-restrained and stoical, are giving help
in the distribution, waiting till all the poor and the ignorant
are fed before they themselves receive their share.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur de Froidmont?' one of them exclaims.
'Why, who is he?'
</p>

<p>
'Who is he?' retorts the Master of the Camp.  'Nay,
by the Mass!  He is above all the most doughty knight
who hath ever wielded a sword.  He it is who has saved
your city for you, my friends.  If the Spanish soldiery is
not inside your walls this night, 'tis to him that ye owe
it, remember!'
</p>

<p>
Most of the burghers look gravely puzzled.  Their
spokesman ventures on the remark:
</p>

<p>
'To His Highness the Duc d'Anjou, surely!'
</p>

<p>
The Master of the Camp shrugs his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'That is as it may be,' he says dryly.  'But you might
all have rotted inside your walls but for the valour of
Monseigneur de Froidmont.'
</p>

<p>
'But the Duc d'Anjou...' hazards some one timidly.
</p>

<p>
'A murrain on the Duc d'Anjou!' breaks in the Master
of the Camp good-humouredly.  ''Tis of the defender of
your city you should think at this hour.  Ah!' he exclaims,
with a sigh of satisfaction, ''tis good to hear that your
city fathers at the least are giving him a rousing welcome!'
</p>

<p>
He himself sets up a cheer, which is taken up by his
soldiers; for just then the bells of Notre Dame have begun
their joyous peal.  Soon Ste. Croix follows suit and
St. Géry from the heights toward the north.  Peal after
peal resounds, till the whole air vibrates with that most
inspiriting sound, chasing away with its melody the very
shadow of silence and desolation.
</p>

<p>
The last rays of the sun have now sunk in the west.
Twilight is slowly fading into dusk.  Out beyond Cantimpré,
the herald upon his charger has halted at the foot of
the bridge, the white banner of France, gay with its golden
Fleur de Lys, is gently stirred by the evening breeze.  The
group of cavaliers has halted too, while the defender of
Cambray rides slowly into the city.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Monseigneur the governor awaited the victor in the courtyard
of the citadel.  He stood in the midst of his Sheriffs
and his Provosts and the other dignitaries of the city,
all of them still dignified and imposing, despite the faded
appearance of their clothes and the gaunt, hungry look in
their wan faces.  All around the courtyard was lined with
troops, the mere remnants of the garrison who had fought
so valorously on that never-to-be-forgotten day in April,
a little over four months ago, and of the small body of
French troops who had come to their assistance then.
</p>

<p>
Gilles dismounted at the bridge-head, disdaining, despite
his wounds, the aid of his faithful henchman's arm.  Only
limping very slightly, the bandage on his hand hidden in
the folds of his cloak, he passed in on foot and alone under
the gateway.  For the space of one heart-beat he paused
just inside the courtyard, when he saw before him this
large concourse of people who, at his appearance, had
slowly dropped on their knees.  They were for the most
part faces which had been familiar to him all those months
ago&mdash;faces which even now wore an expression of deference
and of awed respect.
</p>

<p>
A bitter sigh rose to Gilles' lips.  For him, despite the
grandeur of his victory, this was a bitter hour.  Within
the next few moments these proud and brave people would
have to be told that a prince of the House of France had
proved himself to be both fickle and base.  Messire de
Balagny was not there; and at first he did not see
Jacqueline.  She had retired into the guard-room at the desire
of her guardians.  'It were seemly,' they had said, 'that we,
your protectors, should first receive His Highness and pay
him our respects.  Then he will ask for his future bride,
and ours shall be the honour of bringing you to him!'
</p>

<p>
So she was not there for the moment, and Gilles felt
freer in her absence&mdash;even caught himself hoping that he
would not be put to the torture of seeing her again.  It
were best for him and best for her that she should not hear
that awful confession from his lips, that a Valois prince
had broken his word to her, and in his wanton infamy had
repudiated the perfect gift of God which had been offered
to him.
</p>

<p>
'Do not tarry one moment, Messire,' Marguerite de
Navarre had entreated of him at the last.  'Take advantage
of the moment of boundless relief and gratitude when your
victorious troops enter Cambray to release <i>Monsieur</i> of his
promise to wed the Flemish heiress.  Do not enter the city
till you have made it clear to the Flemish lords that the
Duc d'Anjou will accept the Sovereignty of the Netherlands,
and in exchange will give the support of France, of
her wealth and of her armies; but that he will not enter
into personal alliance with one of his future subjects.'
</p>

<p>
So now, when at Gilles' approach the governor and the
city fathers all bent the knee before him, he said at once,
directly and simply:
</p>

<p>
'I entreat you, Messeigneurs, not to kneel to me.  That
honour belongs by right only to the puissant Prince whom I
represent.'
</p>

<p>
'Your Highness&mdash;&mdash;' began d'Inchy humbly.
</p>

<p>
'I am no Highness, Monseigneur,' he rejoined firmly.
'Only the servant of the Duc d'Anjou, who will be here
as soon as may be, to claim from you that gratitude which
you owe to him and not to me.'
</p>

<p>
D'Inchy and the others did not move.  Their limbs were
paralysed, their lips dumb.  Their ears refused to convey
to their over-tired brains that which they had just heard.
It all seemed like a dream; the gathering dusk made everything
appear unreal&mdash;the ringing of the joy-bells, the far-away
crowd of soldiers and cavaliers, who filled the very
air with clatter and jingle of spurs and accoutrements,
with creaking of waggons, snorting of horses and snatches
of songs and laughter.  And in the centre of the courtyard,
this tall figure of a man, with the tattered doublet and the
bleeding hand, and the voice which seemed as if it rose
straight out of a glorious grave.
</p>

<p>
'Do not look so puzzled, Messeigneurs,' Gilles went on
with a smile, half-sad, wholly good-humoured.  'The Duc
d'Anjou will not tarry, my word on it.  He bids me say
that he accepts the Sovereignty of the Netherlands, and
will place at the disposal of her people the might and the
armies of France, his own power, wealth and influence.'
</p>

<p>
Still as in a dream, d'Inchy and the Sheriffs and the
Provosts staggered to their feet.  The mystery, in truth,
was greater than their enfeebled minds could grasp.  They
were for the most part chiefly conscious of a great feeling
of disappointment.
</p>

<p>
Here stood before them, tall and magnificent even beneath
rags and grime, the man whom they revered above all
others, the hero whose personality was enshrined in the
very hearts of the people of Cambray.  What the mystery
was which clung round him they did not know, nor did
they care: he was the man of their choice, the saviour of
Cambray now, as he had been their defender in the hour
of their gravest peril.  The victor of this glorious day was
the hero of the ramparts on that memorable April day, the
man who four months ago had defended them with heart
and will and undaunted courage then, and to whom they
owed their freedom, the honour of their wives and daughters
and the future of their race.
</p>

<p>
To think of him as other than the Duc d'Anjou, their
chosen Sovereign Lord, the husband of Jacqueline de
Broyart, was positive pain.  Most of them even now refused
to believe, stared at Gilles as if he were a wraith set to
mock them in their weakness and their dependence.
</p>

<p>
'Not the Duc d'Anjou?' the Chief Magistrate murmured.
'Impossible!'
</p>

<p>
Gilles could not help but smile at the farcical aspect of
his own tragedy.
</p>

<p>
'It is not only possible, Messeigneurs,' he said, 'but
is e'en a positive fact.  Messire de Balagny would soon
tell you so: and His Highness the Duc d'Anjou himself
will be here on the morrow to prove to you that I am but
an humble substitute, a representative of His Graciousness.'
</p>

<p>
'But,' stammered d'Inchy, still in a state of complete
bewilderment, 'that day in April ... your&mdash;you,
Monseigneur ... in the Town Hall ... Madame Jacqueline...'
</p>

<p>
With a quick gesture, Gilles put up his hand.
</p>

<p>
'I entreat you, Monseigneur,' he said earnestly, 'to
wait awhile ere you probe further into His Highness' secrets.
For the moment, will you not be content to rejoice with
me at your deliverance?  His Highness accepts from you
the Sovereignty of the Netherlands.  To-morrow he will
be here, ready to receive the acclamations and the welcome
of his people.  He hath proved himself not only ready,
but able, to defend you against all your enemies.  He
hath this day gained a signal victory over the powerful
armies of the King of Spain.  Henceforth the whole might
of France will stand between you and the relentless foe
who threatens your lives and your liberties.  Join me,
Messeigneurs,' he concluded earnestly, 'in acclaiming His
Highness the Duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon, prince of the
House of France, as your Sovereign Lord!'
</p>

<p>
His inspiring words were received in silence.  Not one
voice was raised in response to his loyal call.  Gilles frowned,
feeling that the supreme hour had come.  A moment or
two longer, and the inevitable question would be put
'And what of Madame Jacqueline, Monseigneur?  What
of the lady whom His Highness has sworn to wed?'
</p>

<p>
Already he had steeled himself to give answer, though
the answer could only proclaim dishonour, both for himself
and for the Valois prince whom he was trying so faithfully
to serve unto the end.  He saw the frown of puzzlement
which gathered on d'Inchy's brow.  The governor, in truth,
was the first to recover his presence of mind.  Leaning upon
his stick, with back bent, but his whole attitude one of
supreme dignity, he came nearer to Gilles and fixed a stern
gaze upon his face.
</p>

<p>
'If you are not the Duc d'Anjou, Monseigneur,' he said
slowly, 'will you tell us who it was who defended Cambray
with such indomitable valour four months ago?  Will
you tell us who it is that saved Cambray to-day?  For,
of a truth, my friends and I are bewildered, and the mystery
before us is one which we cannot fathom.  Therefore I
dare ask you once again in all respect&mdash;I may say in all
affection: if you are not the Duc d'Anjou, who is it that
stands before me now?'
</p>

<p>
'The saviour of Cambray!' came in a clear, ringing
voice from the further end of the courtyard.  'My promised
Lord and King!'
</p>

<p>
The sound of Jacqueline's voice sent a spark of living
flame through those minds, atrophied by all this mystery.
All eyes were at once turned to where she stood, dimly
outlined in the gathering gloom.  She was clad in a sombre
gown and wore a dark veil over her fair hair.  Her young,
girlish figure, free from the hideous trammels of hoops or
farthingale, appeared ethereal against the background of
grim, frowning walls.  Only the last lingering grey light
in the west brought into bold relief her pale face and
graceful shoulders, smooth like ivory.  Just for a minute or two
she stood quite still, like an exquisitely graven image,
rigidly still yet pulsating with life.  Then she advanced
slowly towards Gilles.  Her eyes held his and he scarcely
dared to breathe, for fear that perfect vision should vanish
into the skies, whence, of a truth, it must have descended.
He could not have uttered a word then, if his very existence
had depended on it.  It seemed to him as if his very heart
had stopped in its beating, as if life and time and the whole
universe was stilled while Jacqueline's blue eyes sought his
own, and she came, with hands extended as if in entreaty,
to him.
</p>

<p>
Was it a minute or a cycle of years!  He himself could
not tell you.  He saw nothing of what went on around;
the city walls had fallen away, the men in their sombre
clothes become mere shadows, the very sky overhead had
receded into the realm of nothingness.
</p>

<p>
And through that state of semi-consciousness, her exquisite
voice came to him as from another world.
</p>

<p>
'Nay! my dear Lord,' she said, with her enchanting
smile, 'you'll not refuse me the joy of paying something
of my country's eternal debt of gratitude to you.'
</p>

<p>
He still stood half-dazed and silent.  Then suddenly he
took her hands and slowly bent the knee, and buried his
battle-stained face in her sweet-scented palms.
</p>

<p>
It had all occurred within half a dozen seconds.  The
governor, the Chief Magistrate, the city fathers, gazed on
uncomprehending, silent and puzzled at what they saw.
After awhile, d'Inchy murmured vaguely:
</p>

<p>
'Madame Jacqueline ... we ... that is...'
</p>

<p>
But quickly now she turned and faced them all, while
Gilles still knelt and rested his hot forehead against her
cool white hand.  Through the gloom they could just discern
her face, white and serene and withal defiant and firm,
and irradiated with an enormous happiness.
</p>

<p>
'Messeigneurs,' she said with solemn earnestness, 'you
heard, two sennights ago, the profession of faith which I
made publicly before the assembled people of Cambray.
There I swore by the living God Who made me that I would
cherish and serve, loyally and faithfully, even until death,
the noble and valorous hero who defended our city in the
hour of her gravest peril.  That dauntless hero is before
you now.  Once again he has saved our city from destruction,
our sisters from dishonour, our men from shame.  To
him did I plight my troth, to him alone will I be true!'
</p>

<p>
Then, as all the men around her remained silent, moved
to the depth of their hearts by the sublime note of passion
which rang through her avowal, she continued, and this
time with a note of unswerving defiance and magnificent
challenge in her voice:
</p>

<p>
'Ask the people of Cambray, Messeigneurs!  Let them
be the arbiters of my fate and their own.  Ask them to
whom they would have me turn now&mdash;to the mighty Prince
who would only use me and them and our valiant race as
stepping stones to his own ambition, or to the hero who
has offered his life for us all.'
</p>

<p>
A low murmur went round the assembly.  Grave heads
were shaken, toil-worn hands were raised to wipe a furtive
tear.  The evening gloom descended upon this strange
scene, upon the reverend seigneurs and the stolid soldiers,
upon the man who was kneeling and the woman&mdash;a mere
girl&mdash;who stood there, commanding and defiant, secure in
her love, proud of her surrender, ready to fight for her
happiness.
</p>

<p>
'Ask the people of Cambray, Messeigneurs,' she reiterated
boldly, 'if you have a doubt!'
</p>

<p>
She let her eyes wander slowly over the crowd.  One
by one, she looked these grave seigneurs in the face, these
men who arrogated the right to rule over her destiny.
They were her friends, had been her daily companions in
the past four months of horror and of misery.  They had
trembled with her over Cambray's danger, had wept with
her over Cambray's woes.  With her they had acclaimed
the hero who had defended them, had wept when they saw
him fall; and to-day, again to-day, had been ready to
deify him as their hero and her knight.
</p>

<p>
'Messeigneurs,' she pleaded, 'ask the people of Cambray.'
</p>

<p>
She knew what would be the people's answer.  Now that
the hour of their liberty had struck, now that the Spaniard
no longer thundered at their gates, they were ready to
carry their Liberator shoulder-high and give him the universe
in their gratitude, if they had it to give.  What cared
they if their Liberator was a Duc d'Anjou or a nameless
knight?  He was the man whom they worshipped, the
man who had made them free.
</p>

<p>
And now, when she still saw doubt, hesitation, embarrassment,
upon the face of all these grave dignitaries, she frowned
with wounded pride and with impatience.
</p>

<p>
'Messeigneurs,' she said boldly, 'Heaven forgive me,
but ye seem to hesitate!  The man to whom you owe your
life, your future, the honour of your name, asks nothing
more of your gratitude.  But I, who am privileged to read
in his heart, know that it is in my power to repay him in
full for all that he hath done.  And yet you hesitate!  I
am content to make appeal to the people of Cambray.  But
I know too what goes on in your minds.  Ye think that ye
are pledged to <i>Monsieur</i> Duc d'Anjou! that Jacqueline
de Broyart, if she refuse to wed him, would sully your honour
and, what were infinitely worse, would besmirch the fair
fame of Flanders.  Isn't that so, Messeigneurs?'
</p>

<p>
Their silence had become eloquent.
</p>

<p>
'The honour of Flanders&mdash;&mdash;' Monseigneur began, then
paused.  A premonition of something which he could not
put into words caused him to remain silent too, and to
let the girl plead her cause without any interruption from
him.
</p>

<p>
'The honour of Flanders, as you say, Monseigneur,'
Jacqueline went on firmly, 'demands above all things that
you and I and the guardians of our city do keep our word.
Therefore, even before we make appeal to the people of
Cambray, we will ask Monseigneur de Froidmont, who is
here on behalf of His Highness, the Duc d'Anjou, to renew
in His Highness' name the demand of my hand in marriage.
On his answer should depend our future conduct.  Is that
not so, Messeigneurs?' she asked once again, and let her
calm gaze wander from one solemn face to the other, search
serenely every troubled eye.
</p>

<p>
D'Inchy this time realized that he must be the spokesman
for all these representatives, his city and of his
province.  Vaguely troubled still by the mystery which
surrounded the man to whom Cambray owed her deliverance,
he thought once for all, by a straight question, to put an
end to the many doubts and fears which assailed him and
his friends.  Jacqueline already had turned once more to
Gilles; with a slight pressure of her hand she asked him to
rise.  This he did, feeling strangely elated, just as if Destiny,
tired of buffeting him, was smiling encouragingly to him
from afar.  In the midst of the many confused impressions
which had struck his wearied mind during the past quarter
of an hour, one thought stood out with heavenly clearness:
Jacqueline loved him!  Her love had neither faltered nor
tired through these weary months.  She was as steadfast
and true to him at this hour as she had been when in the
clematis-covered arbour she had lain against his breast.
Now her woman's quick wit had divined the truth and come
to the aid of her love.  Even when she challenged those
grave seigneurs to ask him the straight and momentous
question, she knew what his answer would be.
</p>

<p>
The task which lay before him no longer seemed irksome
and humiliating.  He still blushed for the shame which
rested on the fickle Prince whom he served, but already in
his heart he had registered the vow that, God helping as
He had done hitherto, the honour of France should shine
forth before these heroic people, in all its brightness and
glory, through the glorious deeds of her sons.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur,' began d'Inchy tentatively, 'you have
heard what Madame Jacqueline de Broyart hath said.  We
have all passed through much sorrow, have witnessed the
miseries and the patience of our people.  The hour of victory
has come, but found us weak in body and tortured in mind.
We place our faith with complete confidence in the honour
and integrity of France.  We are prepared to receive His
Highness, the Duc d'Anjou with open hearts and to acclaim
him as our Sovereign Lord.  Will he in exchange keep faith
with us, and wed our ward, Madame Jacqueline de Broyart,
to whom he hath akeady plighted his troth?'
</p>

<p>
Even while the governor spoke, the city dignitaries all
tried to read the expression on Gilles' face through the
fast-gathering gloom, and anxious eyes scanned those war-worn
features which they had learned to love.  Even through
the darkness they could see him, standing there in his rags
and his battered breastplate, hatless and begrimed, splendid
in his valour and his pride, and with Jacqueline's hand held
tightly in his own&mdash;splendid still, now that he stood silent
and shamed before them all.
</p>

<p>
To Monseigneur's peremptory question he had given no
reply, remained almost motionless, while Jacqueline, proud
in the face of the crying insult which a faithless Prince had
put upon her, threw back her head and gave a deep sigh
of content.
</p>

<p>
Monseigneur the governor had received his answer in
Gilles de Crohin's obstinate silence.  A bitter cry of
unbridled anger rose to his lips, his emaciated hand trembled
visibly upon the stick which he held.
</p>

<p>
Then, just as suddenly, his wrath gave way.  It almost
seemed as if an angel of reconciliation and of love had
whispered into his ear, and had, with cool and gentle fingers,
smoothed away the angry frown upon his brow.  All that
was fine and noble in the heroic race from which he sprang
clamoured for the only possible solution of the present
difficulty, a solution which would ensure the happiness of
a brave and proud woman, and the dignity of the country
which he represented.
</p>

<p>
One last second of hesitation, one final regretful sigh
for the ambitious personal schemes which he saw crumbling
into ashes at his feet, then Monseigneur d'Inchy, governor
of Cambray, sank slowly down on his knees.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur,' he said slowly and impressively, 'Madame
Jacqueline de Broyart has spoken and shown us the path
of our duty.  To-morrow we will acclaim His Highness the
Duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon as our Sovereign Lord; but
to-day we welcome you as the saviour of our city.
Whatever your wishes are, they are a law unto us.  You have
heard what Madame Jacqueline has said.  Will you
in your turn plight your troth to her?  Will you love and
cherish her and serve her faithfully and loyally as her liege
lord, until death?'
</p>

<p>
'And beyond!' Gilles murmured softly.
</p>

<p>
The last streak of grey light was still lingering in the
sky.  Everything in the enclosure of the tall, grim walls
became mysterious and shadowy; darkness drew her
kindly mantle over the scene.  She hid from prying eyes
what went on under the immediate shadow of the great
gate, where for one brief moment Jacqueline lay against
her loved one's heart.
</p>

<p>
From the towers of the city's churches the bells were
still sending their happy carillon through the evening air.
A group of pikemen brought torches into the courtyard.
A wild shout of delight&mdash;the first which Cambray had heard,
for many months&mdash;sent its joyous sound through the evening
air.
</p>

<p>
And in the homes which all these months of misery had
devastated, the sick and the weary roused themselves for
a moment, marvelling what these shouts of joy might mean.
And those who had suffered for so long and who were now
comforted, those who had been hungry and were now fed,
ran into the houses of sickness and of sorrow, in order to
bring the gladsome, the great, the wonderful news.
</p>

<p>
'The Duc d'Anjou, brother of the King of France, is to
be Sovereign Lord of the Netherlands.  He will enter
Cambray to-morrow, with his great army.  He will be proclaimed
Protector of the Liberties of Cambray and Sovereign of
the Cambrésis!'
</p>

<p>
'And he will wed Madame Jacqueline de Broyart, the
great heiress?&mdash;our Jacqueline?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no!  The Duc d'Anjou will be our Sovereign Lord.
But Madame Jacqueline will wed the saviour of Cambray.'

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
